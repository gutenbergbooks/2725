    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. IN WHICH HE VOWS A VOW
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There comes the Green Imp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you hear? Red's coming in on five cylinders for all he can get out
      of 'em. Anybody else would stop and fix up. He's in too much of a hurry&mdash;as
      usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Green Imp tore past the porch where Burns's neighbours waved arms of
      greeting which he failed to see, for he did not turn his head. The car
      went round the curve of the driveway at perilous speed, and only the fact
      that from road to old red barn was a good twenty rods made it seem
      possible that the Green Imp could come to a standstill in time to prevent
      its banging into the rear wall of the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later Burns ran by the Chesters' porch on his way to his own.
      Chester hailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your everlasting hurry, Red? Come up and sit down and cool off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; called back a voice curtly, out of the June twilight. The big
      figure ran on and disappeared into the small house, the door slamming shut
      behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red's in a temper. Tell by the sound of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he ever in anything except a temper?&rdquo; inquired a guest of the
      Chesters. Arthur Chester turned on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show's you don't know him much, Pauline. He's the owner of the fiercest
      good disposition ever heard of. He's the pepperest proposition of an angel
      this earth has ever seen. He's a red-headed, sharp-tongued brute of a
      saint&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Arthur Chester!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a pot of mustard that's clear balm&mdash;if you don't mind getting
      stung when it's applied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going over to get something for this abominable headache&mdash;and,
      incidentally, to find out what's the row. He's probably lost a patient&mdash;it
      always goes to his brain like that. When he abuses his beloved engine that
      way it's because some other machinery has stopped somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he's lost a patient you'd better let him alone, dear,&rdquo; advised his
      wife, Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;he needs to get his mind off it, on me. I can fix up a few
      symptoms for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll see through you,&rdquo; called Mrs. Chester softly, after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt of that. But it may divert him, just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester made his way across the lawn and in at the side door which led to
      the dimly lighted village offices of Redfield Pepper Burns, physician and
      surgeon. Not that the gilt-lettered sign on the glass of the office door
      read that way. &ldquo;R. P. Burns, M.D.&rdquo; was the brief inscription above the
      table of &ldquo;office hours,&rdquo; and the owner of the name invariably so curtailed
      it. But among his friends the full name had inevitably been turned into
      the nickname, for the big, red-haired, quick-tempered, warm-hearted fellow
      was &ldquo;Red Pepper Burns&rdquo; as irresistibly to them as he had been, a decade
      earlier, to his classmates in college.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Chester went in at the door a figure arose slowly from its position&mdash;flung
      full length, face downward, on a couch in the shadowy inner office and
      came into view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toothache? Dentist down the street,&rdquo; said a blurred voice
      unsympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chester laughed. &ldquo;Oh, come, Red,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Give me some of that headache
      dope. I'm all out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to hear it. You don't get any more from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? I've got a sure-enough headache&mdash;I didn't come over to quiz
      you. The blamed thing whizzes like a buzz saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't help it. Go soak it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester advanced. &ldquo;I'll get the powders myself, then. I know the bottle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A substantial barrier interposed. &ldquo;No, you don't. You've taken up six
      ounces of that stuff in seven days. You quit to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Red, what's the use of taking it out on me like that, if you
      are mad at something? If your head&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it did ache&mdash;like ten thousand furies. It might take some of
      the pressure off somewhere else,&rdquo; growled R. P. Burns. He shut the door of
      the inner office hard behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; declared Arthur Chester, suddenly forgetting about his
      headache in his anxiety to know the explanation of the five cylinders. It
      was a small suburban town in which they lived, and if something had gone
      wrong it was a matter of common interest. &ldquo;Can you tell me about it?&rdquo; he
      asked&mdash;a little diffidently, for none knew better than he that things
      could not always be told, and that no lips were locked tighter than Red
      Pepper's when the secret was not his to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engine's on the blink. Got to go out and fix it,&rdquo; was the unpromising
      reply. Burns picked up a sparkplug from the office desk as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had your dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go out with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was an unintelligible grunt. As Chester was about to follow his
      friend out&mdash;for there could be no doubt that Red Pepper Burns was his
      friend in spite of this somewhat surly, though by no means unusual,
      treatment&mdash;another door opened tentatively, and a head was cautiously
      inserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dinner's ready, Doctor Burns,&rdquo; said a doubtful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns turned. &ldquo;Leave a pitcher of milk on the table for me, Cynthia,&rdquo; he
      said in a gentler voice than Chester had yet heard from him tonight, crisp
      though it was. &ldquo;Nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester, catching a glimpse of a brightly lighted dining-room and a table
      lavishly spread, undertook to remonstrate. He had seen the housekeeper's
      disappointed face, also. But Burns cut him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along&mdash;if you must,&rdquo; said he, and stalked out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour, in the light from one of the Green Imp's lamps, Chester sat
      on an overturned box and watched Burns work. He worked savagely, as if
      applying surgical measures to a mood as well as to a machine. He worked
      like a skilled mechanic as well; every turn of a nut, every polish of a
      thread meaning definite means to an end. The night was hot and he had
      thrown off coat and collar and rolled his sleeves high, so a brawny arm
      gleamed in the bright lamplight, and the open shirt exposed a powerful
      neck. Chester, who was of slighter build and not as tall as he would have
      liked to be, watched enviously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever goes wrong with your affairs, Red,&rdquo; he observed suddenly,
      breaking a long interval during which the engine had been made to throb
      and whirl like the &ldquo;ten thousand furies&rdquo; to whom its engineer had lately
      made allusion, &ldquo;you have the tremendous asset of a magnificent body to
      fall back on for comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a movement of the hand Burns stopped his engine, now running quietly,
      and stood up straight. He threw out one bare arm, grimy and oily with his
      labours. &ldquo;Two hours ago,&rdquo; said he in a voice now controlled and solemn,
      &ldquo;if by cutting off that right arm at the shoulder I could have saved a
      human life I'd have done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; retorted Chester quickly, &ldquo;now, two hours after&mdash;would you
      cut it off now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red Pepper looked at him. The arm dropped. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I wouldn't. Not
      for a dozen lives like that. I'm not heroic, after all&mdash;only hot and
      cold by jumps, like a thermometer. But I ache all over, just the same. She
      runs like a bird now. Jump in&mdash;we'll take a spin and try her out on
      the road. I may need her before midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing loth, for he knew the Green Imp and her driver and had had many a
      swift run on a moonlight night before in the same company, Chester took
      the slim roadster's other seat, watching the long green hood point the way
      down the driveway, past the porch where the women, in white gowns showing
      coolly in the light from the arc lamp at the corner of the street, called
      a goodbye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back&mdash;some time,&rdquo; replied Chester's voice, rising above the low purr
      of the engine with a note of satisfaction in it. The figure beside him,
      still in open, white shirt, with bare arms and uncovered, thick thatch of
      red hair, did not turn its head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur's never so happy as when he's out with Red in the Green Imp,&rdquo;
       Winifred said to her guest as the roadster shot away under the elms which
      drooped beneath the arc light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Burns is certainly the oddest man I ever saw,&rdquo; replied the guest,
      swinging idly in the hammock and watching the car out of sight down the
      long vista of the village street. &ldquo;He hasn't given me one real good look
      yet. I suppose if I were a patient he would favour me with an all-seeing
      gaze out of those Irish-Scotch barbarian eyes of his, but as it is&rdquo;&mdash;her
      voice was slightly petulant&mdash;&ldquo;I believe I shall have to do as Arthur
      has: make up some symptoms and go over to his office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do you'll get precisely the same treatment I presume Arthur had.&rdquo;
       Mrs. Chester laughed as she spoke. &ldquo;I doubt very much whether he comes
      back with any headache medicine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he got a moonlight ride in that beauty of a car,&rdquo; the guest declared
      enviously. &ldquo;That treatment would suit me wonderfully well, whatever was
      the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have gone with him in his shirt-sleeves? He's plainly in a
      shirt-sleeve mood to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a drive in the moonlight with a 'brute of a saint' in
      shirt-sleeves, with arms like those, might be interesting,&rdquo; mused the
      guest, indicating invisible patterns on the porch with the toe of a white
      slipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would probably talk cars and engines every mile in the most
      matter-of-fact way,&rdquo; Winifred Chester assured her. &ldquo;No woman yet has ever
      been able, as far as this town knows, to strike a spark of romance out of
      Red Pepper Burns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet he has red hair,&rdquo; murmured the guest to herself, and continued to
      look thoughtfully down the street along which the Green Imp had shot out
      toward the open country beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in that open country, miles away, the car running with that exquisite
      precision of rotating cylinder explosions which is music to the trained
      ear of the mechanic at the wheel, the two men sat silent. The pace of the
      Green Imp was one to cut off speech, for the road wets straight and empty,
      stretching like a white ribbon under the stars, with now and then a band
      of midnight shade crossing it where arching tree-tops met the course which
      invites an open throttle and the intent eye which goes with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the car struck aside from the straightaway and with open cut-out
      roared up a steep hill by means of which a narrow road led off toward a
      part of the country not often selected by motorists for pleasure spins.
      Chester recognized that his companion had a purpose beyond that of &ldquo;trying
      out&rdquo; his engine, unless, indeed, the tough and rocky grade were a test.
      But Burns was still silent, and the other man applied himself to holding
      on. A mile up the road the car came to an abrupt standstill before a tiny
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to make a call, after all?&rdquo; was on Chester's lips, but the sight of
      something, showing white beside the door in the lamplight which streamed
      out upon a small, decrepit porch, drove back the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns left a silent engine and strode up the straggling path with the
      light tread of the heavy man whose muscles are under his control. He
      walked in at the open door without knocking, and Chester caught the sharp
      sound of a woman's voice at a tension, saying: &ldquo;Oh, Doctor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him an hour, though by his watch it was but nine minutes,
      that he sat watching the little flimsy streamer of white flutter to and
      fro in the lamplight, his heart beating heavily, as a father's will at
      sight of the sign of some other man's loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of those interminable nine minutes Burns was back again in the
      car. He turned the Green Imp about as quietly as if she were a cat
      stealing out of the yard, and sent her down the rocky road at her slowest
      speed. At the bottom of the hill he broke the long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't have slept an hour if I hadn't come back,&rdquo; he said in a low
      tone. &ldquo;Back and apologized for being a brute. It's eased me up a bit I
      think it's eased her, too, poor soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it wasn't losing the case,&rdquo; Chester began doubtfully. He was never
      sure just when it was safe to ask Red Pepper questions, but he thought it
      seemed safer than usual now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn't losing the case, though that was bad enough. It was losing
      my infernal hair-trigger of a temper that's been cutting in like a knife.
      I had the boy where he ought to get well if they followed my precautions a
      thousand times repeated. This morning his heart was a whole lot stronger;
      it only needed time. Tonight his mother let him sit up&mdash;in spite of
      all I'd threatened her with if she did. He went out like a snuffed candle.
      When I saw it I was so angry with her I&rdquo;&mdash;he thrust up one hand and
      ran it through his thick locks with a gesture of savagery&mdash;&ldquo;I let
      loose on her&mdash;poor soul with her heart already broken. He was the
      only boy&mdash;of course,&mdash;I ought to have been shot on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sent the car flying down the road. Chester could think of nothing to
      say. He could imagine the sort of apology Red had given the boy's mother&mdash;one
      to make her forgive and adore him. No doubt it had &ldquo;eased her.&rdquo; It must
      have been a hard thing for R. P. Burns, M.D., to do. Suddenly recalling
      this he said so, and added a word of admiration. Burns turned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'm the toughest case on my list. I'm a chronic patient.
      Just as I think I have myself in hand I suffer a relapse. I break out in a
      new place. Of all men who need self-control, it's a surgeon needs it most.
      Sometimes, I'm in too much of a temper to operate&mdash;just because a
      nurse has failed to provide the right sutures. Every red hair on my head
      stands up like a porcupine's quills&mdash;my hand isn't steady&mdash;I can't
      trust my own judgment till I've cooled down. There's only one hope for me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off abruptly, and the Green Imp accelerated her pace as they came
      to the long, straight road home. Until they reached the turn under the
      elms which led to the town, he left the sentence unfinished, while Chester
      waited. Chester felt it would be worth waiting for&mdash;that which Red
      Pepper might say next. When it came it surprised him&mdash;it even gave
      him a strange thrill coming from Red Pepper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've put my case into the only competent hands,&rdquo; said Burns slowly and
      quite simply. &ldquo;I've promised my Maker I'll never insult His name again.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. IN WHICH HE CREATES A CIRCUS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Burns&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Mathewson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The long-distance telephone, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns excused himself to the last patient of the evening series, and shut
      himself in with the long-distance. When he came out he was looking at his
      watch. From its face he turned to that of his office nurse&mdash;the one
      hardly less businesslike in expression than the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Mathewson, my aunt telephones that my father and mother are both
      sick, each anxious to distraction about the other, she about them both,
      and under the weather herself. If you and I can catch the ten-fifteen
      to-night we can be there by two, and by leaving there at four we can be
      back here in time for the morning's operations. If they need you I'll
      leave you there for a day or two&mdash;by your leave. We'll take the Green
      Imp into the city&mdash;the ten-fifteen doesn't stop here. Then it'll be
      at the hospital when we want it in the morning. You've twenty minutes to
      get ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Doctor Burns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The office bell rang. Burns fled toward the inner office. Miss Mathewson
      discovered the guest of the Chesters on the doorstep&mdash;all in white,
      with a face which usually stimulated interest wherever it was seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I see Doctor Burns just a minute&mdash;for Mr. Chester?&rdquo; The caller
      took her cue cleverly from Miss Mathewson's face, which at the moment
      expressed schedules and engagements thick as blackberries in August.
      Burns, just closing the inner door, caught Chester's name. He pulled off
      his white office coat, slid into his gray tweed one, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for Mr. Chester&mdash;in three minutes?&rdquo; he inquired,
      coming forward. Miss Mathewson, aware of the shortness of time, vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me something for his headache, please,&rdquo; replied the young person in
      white promptly. Schedules and engagements were in R. P. Burns's eyes also;
      they looked at her without appearing to see her at all. To this she was
      not accustomed and it displeased her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it too severe for him to come himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much too severe. He has gone to bed with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Chester closely attending him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;or I shouldn't be here.&rdquo; The eyes of the Chesters' guest
      sparkled. Something about the cool tone of this question displeased her
      still more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him to get up and go out and walk a mile, breathing deep all the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No medicine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a grain. He ought to know better than to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does, I think. He suggested that possibly if I asked&mdash;But I see
      for myself how that wouldn't make the slightest difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad your perceptions are so acute,&rdquo; replied Burns gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the three minutes up?&rdquo; asked the caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch. &ldquo;I think not quite. Is there anything of
      importance to fill the one remaining?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever&mdash;except to mention your fee.&rdquo; The guest receded
      gracefully from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the patient will follow directions I'll ask no fee. If he doesn't I'll
      exact one when I see him again. Forgive my haste, Miss&mdash;Halstead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hempstead,&rdquo; corrected the caller crisply. &ldquo;Don't mention it, Doctor&mdash;Brown.
      Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chesters' guest lingered on the porch before going in to report the
      failure of her mission. She was still lingering there when the Green Imp,
      carrying no open-shirted mechanic, but a properly clothed professional
      gentleman and a severely dressed professional lady, whirled away down the
      drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He really was going somewhere in a hurry, then,&rdquo; admitted the guest. &ldquo;In
      which case I can't be quite so offended. I wonder if that nurse enjoys her
      trips with him&mdash;when his mouth doesn't happen to be shut like a steel
      trap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she could have seen the pair on the train which presently bore them
      flying away across the state, she would hardly have envied either of them.
      Between abstraction on the one side and reserve an the other, they
      exchanged less conversation than two strangers might have done. When Miss
      Mathewson's eyes drooped with weariness her companion made her as
      comfortable as he could and bade her rest. His own eyes were untouched by
      slumber: he stared straight before him or out into the night, seeing
      nothing but a white farmhouse far ahead, where his anxious thoughts were
      waiting for his body to catch up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they much sick, Zeke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I dunno hardly, Red.&mdash;You goin' to drive? They're pretty
      lively, them blacks. Ain't used to comin' to the station at two o'clock in
      the mornin'. Your ma's been worryin' about your pa for a consid'able
      spell, and now that she's took down so severe herself he's gone to pieces
      some. Miss Ellen'll be glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blacks covered the mile from the station as they had never covered it
      before, and Burns was in the house five minutes before they had expected
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, here's your big boy.&mdash;Dad, here I am&mdash;here's Red. Bless
      your hearts&mdash;you wanted me, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They could hardly tell him how they had wanted him, but he saw it in their
      faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to take the four o'clock back&mdash;worse luck!&mdash;for some
      operations I can't postpone. But between now and then I'm going to look
      you over and set you straight, and I'll be back again in two days if you
      need me. Now for it. Mother first. Come here, Aunt Ellen, and tell me all
      about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      R. P. Burns, M.D., had never been quicker nor more thorough at examination
      of a pair of patients than with these. He went straight at them both, each
      in the presence of the other, Miss Mathewson capably assisting. With his
      most professional air he asked his questions, applied his trained senses
      to the searching tests made of special organs, and gave directions for
      future treatment. Then he sat back and looked at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I appear worried about her, Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you don't seem to, Red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Mathewson, should you gather from my appearance that I am consumed
      with anxiety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you seem very much relieved, Doctor Burns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, as you look at Dad over on the couch there, does he strike you as
      appearing like a frightfully sick man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Burns smiled faintly in the direction of the couch, but her eyes came
      immediately back to her son's. &ldquo;He seems a good deal better since you
      came, Redfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's not a thing the matter with either of you except what can be
      fixed up in a week. You've got scared to death about each other, and
      that's pulled you both down. What you need more than anything else is to
      go to a circus&mdash;and, by George!&mdash;Since I didn't observe any
      tents in the darkness as we drove along, you shall have one come to you.
      Look here! Did you know I'd kept up my old athletic stunts these nine
      years since I left college?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled off his coat, waistcoat, collar, shoes, rolled his shirt-sleeves
      as high as they would go, and turned a series of handsprings across the
      wide room. Then he stood on his head; he balanced chairs on his chin; he
      seized his father's hickory stick and went through a set of military
      evolutions. Then he put on his shoes, eyeing his patients with
      satisfaction. His mother had lifted her head to watch him, and Miss
      Mathewson had tucked an extra pillow under it. His father had drawn
      himself up to a half-sitting posture and was regarding his son with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought so well of those doings before,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;If
      they've kept you as supple as a willow, in spite of your weight, I should
      say you'd better keep 'em up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I will!&mdash;See here, Aunt Ellen&mdash;you used to play the
      'Irish Washerwoman: Mind playing it now? Miss Mathewson and I are going to
      do a cakewalk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced, laughing, at his office nurse. She was staring at him
      wide-eyed. He threw back his head, showing a splendid array of white teeth
      as he roared at her expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget 'Doctor Burns,' please,&rdquo; said he, in answer to the expression.
      &ldquo;He's discharged this case as not serious enough for him, and left it to
      Red Pepper to administer a few gentle stimulants on the quack order. Come!
      You can do a cake walk! Forget you're a graduate of any training school
      but the vaudeville show!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her hand. Flushing so that her plain face became almost pretty,
      she yielded&mdash;for the hand was insistent. Miss Ellen leaned bewildered
      against the door which led to the sitting-room where the old piano stood.
      Her nephew looked at her again, with the eyes which the Chesters' guest
      had somewhat incoherently described as &ldquo;Irish-Scotch-barbarian.&rdquo; He said,
      &ldquo;Please, Aunt Ellen, there's a good fellow,&rdquo; at which Mr. Burns, Senior,
      chuckled under his breath; for anything less like that of a &ldquo;good fellow&rdquo;
       was never seen than Sister Ellen's prim little personality. Miss Ellen
      went protestingly to the piano. Was it right, her manner said, to be
      performing in this idiotic manner at this unholy hour of three o'clock in
      the morning&mdash;in a sick-room?
    </p>
    <p>
      It mattered little whether Miss Mathewson could or could not dance the
      &ldquo;Irish Washerwoman,&rdquo; or any other antic dance improvised to that live air;
      she had only to yield herself to Red Pepper Burns's hands and steps, and
      let him disport himself around her. A most startlingly hilarious
      performance was immediately and effectively produced. At the height of it,
      a door across the sitting-room, which commanded a strip of the bedroom
      beyond, opened cautiously and Zeke Crandall's eye glued itself to the
      aperture, an eye astonished beyond belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that there Red ain't a-cuttin' up jest exactly as he used to when he
      was a boy&mdash;and his pa and ma sick a-bed! If 'twas anybody but Red I'd
      say he was crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he caught the sound of a laugh from lips he had not heard laugh like
      that for a year&mdash;a chuckling, delighted laugh, only slightly
      asthmatic and wholly unrestrained. He began to laugh himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If folks round here could see Red Burns now they'd never believe the
      stories about his gettin' to be such a darned successful man at his
      business,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Of all the goin's on! Look at him now! An' that
      nurse! An' Miss Ellen a-playin' for 'em! Oh, my eye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Songs followed&mdash;college songs, popular airs, opera bits&mdash;all
      delivered in' a resounding barytone and accompanied by thumping chords
      improvised by the performer. Out through the open windows they floated,
      and one astonished villages driving by to take the early train caught the
      exultant strains:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Oh, see dat watermillion a-smilin' fro' de fence,
    How I wish dat watermillion it was mine.
   Oh, de white folks must be foolish,
   Dey need a heap of sense,
    Or dey'd nebber leave it dar upon de vine!
    Oh, de ham-bone am sweet,
    An' de bacon am good,
    An' de 'possum fat am berry, berry fine;
   But gib me, yes, gib me,
   Oh, how I wish you would,
    Dat watermillion growin' on de vine!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Before they knew it the early morning light was creeping in at the
      small-paned windows. Burns consulted his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'll give us a cup of coffee, Aunt Ellen, we'll be off in fifteen
      minutes. Miss Mathewson&rdquo;&mdash;his glance mirthfully surveyed her&mdash;&ldquo;Aunt
      Ellen will take you upstairs and give you a chance to put that magnificent
      brown hair into a condition where it will not shock the natives at the
      station. As for mine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Aunt Ellen and Miss Mathewson, each in her own way feeling as if she
      had passed through an extraordinary experience likely never to occur
      again, had hurried away, Burns applied himself to a process of
      reconstruction. When every rebellious red hair had been reduced to its
      usual order and his thick locks lay with the little wave in them as his
      mother had begun to brush them years ago; when collar and cravat rose
      sedately above the gray tweed coat, and a fresh, fine handkerchief had
      replaced the dingy one which had been through every manner of exercise in
      the &ldquo;circus,&rdquo; Burns drew up a chair and faced his patients with the keen,
      professional gaze which told him whether or not his night's work had been
      good therapeutics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I've gone you're to have breakfast, and I think you'll both eat it,&rdquo;
       he said, smiling at them, his eyes bright with affection and contentment.
      &ldquo;Then you're to compose yourselves for sleep, and I think you'll both
      sleep. To-morrow Dad's to be out on the porch&mdash;all June is out there,
      and the roses are in full bloom. Day after to-morrow Mother'll be there,
      too, in the hammock. As soon as these cases I operate on this morning are
      out of danger I'll be down again for a whole day. I'll keep the time
      clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid,&rdquo; said his father, looking suddenly anxious for a new cause,
      &ldquo;your being up all night won't make your hand any steadier for those
      operations, Red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, as a matter of fact, Dad, it'll be a lot steadier just
      because of my being up all night, assuring myself that there's nothing
      serious the matter with you and Mother, except the need of a bit of
      jollying by your boy&mdash;which you've certainly had right off the reel,
      eh? Aunt Ellen thinks yet I've probably killed you. Are you the worse for
      it, Mother? Give it to me straight, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent over her, his fingers on her delicate wrist. She smiled up into
      his eyes. &ldquo;Redfield!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;As if I could ever be the worse for
      having you come home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped on his knees beside the bed, looking at her with the eyes of
      the boy she had borne. &ldquo;Bless me, Mother,&rdquo; he said unsteadily, all the fun
      gone out of his face. &ldquo;I&mdash;need it&mdash;to keep decent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last three words were under his breath, but she heard the others and
      laid her hand on the red head with a tremulous soft word or two which he
      could barely catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a minute he had risen, his cheek flushed high, and was gripping his
      father's hand. &ldquo;You, too, Dad,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I'm only Red this morning&mdash;going
      back into the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His father's hand and voice shook as he administered the little ceremony,
      used only once before in his son's life&mdash;when at fourteen he first
      went away to school. Few grown men would have asked for it again, he felt
      that. Coming from Red he was sure the request meant more than they could
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the professional gentleman whom the world knew&mdash;the world which
      was not acquainted with Red Pepper Burns&mdash;and the professional lady
      who was his assistant went decorously away into the early June morning.
      Zeke was grinning to himself as he saw them step aboard the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks mighty fine in them clipper-built city clothes, Red does,&rdquo; he
      reflected. &ldquo;If that there young woman chose to give him away, now but I
      kind of guess she won't&mdash;under the circumstances!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. IN WHICH HE ASSUMES A RESPONSIBILITY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red, the new car is here. Come and look her over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Burns's neighbour on the other side, James Macauley, Junior. R. P.
      Burns laid down his saw, with which in the late June twilight he had been
      doing vigorous work at a small woodpile behind the house. He stood up
      straight, throwing back his shoulders to take the kink out of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I think I'm fit for general society again. I wasn't
      when I tackled this job. Nothing like fifteen minutes of woodpile for
      taking the temper out of the saw&mdash;and the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Macauley, a stout, good-humoured fellow of thirty-five, laughed. &ldquo;That
      temper of yours, Red has it been on the rampage again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has. Don't talk about it or it'll lift to confounded red head again&mdash;it's
      only scotched for the present. New car's here, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the pretty widow's here, too&mdash;my wife's sister, Ellen
      Lessing. We've a great plan for tomorrow, Red. I can't venture to drive
      this elephant of a car yet, but the women are wild for a trip in her. She
      holds seven. Martha wants you to drive us and the Chesters to-morrow a
      hundred and fifty miles&mdash;seventy-five to F &mdash;&mdash; and back. Will you
      do it? You're not so horribly busy just now, and Mrs. Lessing and Pauline
      Hempstead together ought to make it worth while for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This feature of the invitation did not appear to appeal to Burns, but the
      sight of the touring car, brave and shining in russet and brass, plainly
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I'd care to drive such a whale for myself, but I shouldn't mind
      a run for the fun of trying her out. You say she's been driven enough to
      warm up her engines? Suppose we take her out and let me get the feel of
      her mouth before to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; And they were off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a whale she's a bird,&rdquo; was Burns's paradoxical verdict two hours
      later. The &ldquo;trying out&rdquo; had merged into a smooth run of forty-five miles
      at not anything like the full pace of which the motor was capable. &ldquo;Best
      not to overheat her at first. Run your first three hundred miles with
      consideration for her vital organs&mdash;she'll have her wind by that
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning four women, long-coated, tissue-veiled, watched the brown
      beauty roll invitingly up to Macauley's porch steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she crossed the lawn with Winifred, Pauline Hempstead, the guest of the
      Chesters, was studying not only the car, but the undeniably attractive
      gray-clad figure of the lately-arrived younger sister of Mrs. Macauley.
      &ldquo;Will Red P. look at her any more than he does at me?&rdquo; she murmured in
      Winifred Chester's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it, my dear. But he'll be foolish if he doesn't, won't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care for widows myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume not.&rdquo; Winifred laughed comprehendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-eight, I believe&mdash;though she doesn't look it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't look it! She looks a lot more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred laughed still, quietly. Although Pauline undoubtedly had the
      advantage of Ellen in years, her fair-haired, blue-eyed, somewhat
      sumptuous beauty was not of so youthful a type as the darker colouring and
      slenderer outlines of Martha's sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at the wheel of the brown car lifted his leather cap as the women
      came out, but he left all the bestowal of them to the other men. Miss
      Hempstead asked to be allowed to sit beside the driver, but Macauley vowed
      that on the first long run of his new machine he himself should occupy
      that post of honour and interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming back, then,&rdquo; insisted the girl, and Macauley agreed reluctantly.
      Burns made no comment, but applied himself to his task&mdash;not only
      then, but also for every minute of the seventy-five miles to their
      destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might as well be a hired chauffeur,&rdquo; complained Miss Hempstead when,
      during a stop of ten minutes on account of a switching freight train, she
      had leaned forward and attempted in vain to carry on a conversation with
      Burns. &ldquo;That abstracted mood of his&mdash;is there any breaking into it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fall out and break your collar-bone. He'll be all attention,&rdquo; advised
      Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I'm almost tempted to. Why don't you drive awhile, Mr.
      Macauley, and give him a rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And let him sit here in the middle with you? He couldn't be pried loose
      from that wheel now. Besides, I haven't driven this car yet, and she's too
      different in her steering from my old one. I shouldn't like to try with
      this crowd behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached the distant city; drew up at the steps of the most attractive
      hotel; went in to lunch. That is to say, all did this except R. P. Burns.
      He remained in the garage in the rear where he had taken the car, busying
      himself with some details of mechanism whose working did not quite suit
      him. In spite of summons and appeals he continued to work until the rest
      had finished; then he bolted in to wash off dust and engine grease, ate
      his lunch in ten minutes&mdash;Macauley sitting by and expostulating&mdash;and
      bolted out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're going to walk about a bit,&rdquo; Chester announced, invading the garage.
      &ldquo;The girls insist that you come. Where are your eyes, man? If Pauline
      bores you&mdash;I admit that she's a trifle persistent, but she's jolly
      good company, I think&mdash;try Mrs. Lessing. She's delightful, and not
      the pursuing style at all&mdash;she's learned better. She hasn't shown the
      slightest interest in you all morning. That ought to attract you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to try a bit of adjustment on this timer now that Mac's out of
      the way. Go along, and don't bother me.&rdquo; Burns was in his shirt-sleeves
      again and spoke gruffly. His cap was off, and thick locks lay damply
      against his moist brow; in his eyes sparkled enthusiasm but not for women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly are a hopeless case,&rdquo; and Chester went back to his party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might as well not have a bachelor along,&rdquo; mourned Pauline. &ldquo;Four women&mdash;with
      only two old married men to look after them&mdash;it's a shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we're both of us much handsomer than Red Pepper Burns,&rdquo; asserted
      James Macauley, Junior. &ldquo;And I've hardly spoken a word to my wife since I
      started&mdash;that sort of thing ought to content you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't. And neither of you is half as good-looking as Doctor Burns.
      He has the most interesting profile I ever saw&mdash;and I ought to know&mdash;I
      seldom catch sight of his full face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't suppose an interesting profile, whatever that is, would
      offset a shock of fire-red hair. Now, both Chester's hair and mine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His hair isn't fire-red. It's a&mdash;rather strong&mdash;auburn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Macauley shouted and the rest laughed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather strong! I should say it was. I've been worried about having him
      sit near the gasoline tank, it brings his hair so close to a high
      combustible. But it has one advantage: if we don't get home before dark we
      shan't need to light up. Red's torch of a head will do the trick; we can
      come in by the refulgence from that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be sitting in its light going back, anyhow,&rdquo; Miss Hempstead
      exulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much good it will do you,&rdquo; prophesied Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did Pauline so much good as that she was able to obtain many looks at
      the profile she admired, for she saw it clean-cut against the passing
      landscape for the sixty miles of daylight out of the seventy-five miles
      home, while she sat beside its owner and tried many times to draw him into
      talk. His taciturnity on this particular day was a thing beyond any
      experience with it she had yet had. She had heard Burns talk, and talk
      well, on many different subjects, the while he sat upon the Chesters'
      porch of a summer evening, the three of them about him, and he had seemed
      to enjoy talking. He certainly could not be wholly occupied with the
      machine, for at no time did he let the engine out for what it could do,
      but contented himself with a steady, moderate pace very different from the
      sort of furious speed in which he and the Green Imp were accustomed to
      indulge when occasion offered. Altogether he presented to the girl a
      problem which she could not solve and was never further from solving than
      during the seventy-five miles she sat beside him on the run home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're all to come in and have an ice-cool, salad-y supper with us,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Macauley declared as the car turned in at the home driveway. &ldquo;Hot coffee,
      too, if you want it&mdash;or even beefsteak if you prefer. But I thought
      since it was so hot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the beefsteak,&rdquo; announced Burns over his shoulder, &ldquo;if I find
      nothing urgent for, me to do. If there's a call&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is, make it, and you shall have the beefsteak when you get
      back,&rdquo; Martha promised him. Mrs. Macauley was of the sort of young married
      woman who delights to make her friends comfortable&mdash;and none better
      than Red Pepper, who was her husband's most valued friend, as he was that
      of his neighbour on the other side, Arthur Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      To everybody's regret the call was waiting, and as the party went in to
      supper they waved their hands at the Green Imp flying away down the road.
      It was not till long after the &ldquo;ice-cool, salad-y supper&rdquo; was ended and
      the women, freshly clad, were sitting on the porch again, the men smoking
      on the steps below them, that tine Green Imp came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later a large figure crossed the lawn at a pace which
      suggested both reluctance and fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it hadn't been for that beefsteak&mdash;&rdquo; Burns began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't have come,&rdquo; finished Macauley. &ldquo;Oh, we know that! Go in and
      get it, Red, and perhaps afterward the charms of human society will have
      their inning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not the beefsteak made the difference, a change had taken place
      when R. P. Burns at length returned to the comforts of the porch. He threw
      himself upon a crimson cushion on the upper step, precisely at the feet,
      as it chanced, of Ellen Lessing. As he leaned comfortably back against the
      porch pillar he looked directly up into her face, his eyes meeting hers
      with an odd, searching expression as if he now saw her for the first time.
      Pauline, gazing enviously across, saw the black eyes meet the hazel ones
      in the dim light, and noted that a curiously long look was exchanged&mdash;the
      sort of look which denotes that two people are observing each other
      closely, without attempt at producing an impression, only at discovering
      what is there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Burns began to talk he appeared to address the midsummer night
      air, staring off into it and speaking rather low, so that they all leaned
      forward to listen. For, at last, he seemed to have something other than
      motor cars upon his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a mighty taking little chap,&rdquo; he said musingly. &ldquo;Curly black hair,
      eyes like coals&mdash;with a fringe around 'em like a hedge. Cheeks none
      too round&mdash;but milk and eggs and good red steaks will take care of
      that. A body like a cherubs&mdash;when it's filled out a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the name of gibberish are you giving as, Red?&rdquo; inquired Macauley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name's Bob,&rdquo; went on Red Pepper. &ldquo;By all the odd chances! That's what
      decided me. 'Bobby Burns'&mdash;it was the last straw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he crazy?&rdquo; asked Chester of the company. They seemed undecided. They
      were listening closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clothes&mdash;one pair of patched breeches&mdash;remember 'Little
      Breeches,' Ches?&mdash;one faded flannel shirt&mdash;mended till there
      wasn't much left to mend. A straw hat with a fringe around it&mdash;uneven
      fringe. Inside&mdash;a heartache as big as a little fellow could carry and
      stagger under it. Think of having the heartache&mdash;at five and for your
      grandmother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why for his grandmother?&rdquo; asked Winifred Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there wasn't anybody else to have it for. Rest all gone,
      grandmother the one who attended the breeches and patched the shirt, and
      went without food herself lest the boy's cheeks get thinner yet. That was
      what fixed her at last&mdash;she hadn't enough vitality to pull her
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that was the matter with you to-day,&rdquo; hazarded Chester. &ldquo;Worried about
      your patient all day and found you'd lost her when you got back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns turned upon him with a characteristic flash. &ldquo;You go join the ranks
      of the snap-shots. They sometimes miss fire. No, I didn't. I'd lost her
      before I went or I wouldn't have gone, not for you or any other box-party.
      It was the kiddie that was on my mind&mdash;as I'd seen him last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; asked Martha Macauley urgently. She was the mother of
      two small sons, and Burns's sketch had interested her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her. &ldquo;Want to see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. Did you take him to somebody in town? Are you going to
      send him to the asylum in the city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to see him?&rdquo;. Burns inquired of Winifred Chester. He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red! What do you mean? Have you got a child here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, all of you, if you like. He won't wake up. He's sleeping like
      a top&mdash;can't help it, with all that bread and milk inside of him.
      Part cream it was, too. I saw Cynthia chucking it in. He'd got her, good
      and plenty, in the first five minutes. Bless her susceptible heart! Come
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk of susceptible hearts,&rdquo; jeered Macauley as he followed. &ldquo;There's the
      softest one in the county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody would ever guess it,&rdquo; murmured Pauline Hempstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tiptoed into the house, across the offices into the big, square room
      which was Burns's own. He switched on a hooded reading-light beside the
      bed and turned it so that its rays fell on the small occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay in spread-eagle, small-child fashion, arms and legs thrown wide,
      the black, curly head disdaining the pillow, one fist clutching a man's
      riding-crop. In sleep the little face was an exquisite one; the onlookers
      might guess what it would be awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns pointed at the crop, smiling. &ldquo;That was the nearest approach to a
      plaything I could muster to-night. To-morrow the shops will help me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send over plenty in the morning, Red,&rdquo; whispered Martha Macauley.
      Her eyes were suspiciously shiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you bring him home just now?&rdquo; questioned Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns nodded. &ldquo;I hadn't meant to get him to-night, if I did at all. My
      call took me within half a mile. I went over and saw him again. That
      settled it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The small sleeper stirred, sighed. Burns turned off the light in a
      twinkling. &ldquo;He's not used to electricity point blank,&rdquo; he chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going down the steps a hand touched his arm. He looked into Ellen
      Lessing's upturned face and discovered anew that it was a face to hold the
      attention of a man. But there was no coquetry in it. Instead, he saw a
      stirred look in eyes which struck him suddenly as singularly like those of
      the child he had just shown her, &ldquo;black, with a fringe around 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Burns,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you give me the very great pleasure of
      dressing the boy? I know how to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if you want to,&rdquo; he responded gladly. &ldquo;I hoped you ladies
      would look after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me do it alone,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;They have their children: it would only
      be a task to them. To me&mdash;I can't tell you what a delight it would
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take you and Bob to the city in the morning if you'll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a happy morning for Bob and me, then,&rdquo; she answered, and he
      saw it in her face that it would be. But he felt that it was because of
      the boy; not for any other reason. It occurred to him that it might
      possibly be a happy morning for the driver of the Green Imp, also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Ellen's going to dress the brat.&rdquo; Macauley was strolling over the lawn
      with Chester and Burns, as, having out-sat the women on the Macauley
      porch, the men were turning bedward, reluctant to leave the cool
      star-shine of the July night. &ldquo;It's easy to see why she wants to do that.
      Her three-year-old boy would have been just about this Bob's age by now.
      Tough luck, wasn't it?&mdash;when he was all she had left since Jack got
      out of the game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns stared at him. &ldquo;Oh, that's why? I didn't know about her boy, or I'd
      forgotten it if I was ever told. She will enjoy fitting Bob out, if I can
      keep her from putting him into white clothes to make him resemble an angel
      instead of a small boy with an eye for dirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find Ellen's no fool,&rdquo; Macauley assured him warmly. &ldquo;But if she
      takes an interest in the boy it'll be the best thing that could happen to
      him. She has a lot of money. She may get a notion to adopt him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But upon this Red Pepper Burns spoke with decision. &ldquo;Confound you, the
      kiddie belongs to me. Didn't I tell you his name is now Robert Burns? She
      may dress him if she likes. She can't have him, not by a long shot. He's
      mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, it might be arranged,&rdquo; murmured Macauley, but not quite low
      enough. In a flash he was laid flat on his back on the lawn, a menacing
      figure standing over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of that!&rdquo; growled the man with the temper. &ldquo;Not now or any other
      time.&rdquo; Then he laughed and let his victim up. &ldquo;Alcohol will take out grass
      stains, Jim,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;Tell Martha that.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. IN WHICH HE MAKES A CONCESSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Red Pepper Burns opened his eyes. What on earth was that? A small voice
      piping at him from within close range? But how could that be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Something bumped against him. He turned his head on his pillow. A small
      figure at his side had raised itself upon its elbow; big black eyes in a
      pale little face were staring at him in affright. Burns roused himself,
      suddenly very wide awake indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, little man,&rdquo; said he, pulling the child gently into the
      warmth of his encircling arm. &ldquo;You came home with me last night. Don't you
      remember? You're going to make me a visit. And this morning after
      breakfast we're going to drive to town and buy a train of cars&mdash;red,
      shiny cars and an engine with a bell on it. What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not take long to change Bob's fright into the happiest
      anticipations. Red Pepper Burns was at his best with children; he had what
      their mothers called &ldquo;a way with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A knock at the door and Cynthia's voice calling, &ldquo;Here's some things for
      the little boy, Doctor,&rdquo; put an end to a full half-hour of delightful
      comradeship, during which the sheets of the bed had became a tent and the
      two were soldiers resting after a day's march. Burns rose and took in the
      parcel. Martha Macauley had sent it. Her boy Harold was the nearest in
      size to Bob of any of the children of his neighbours, and the parcel held
      everything needed from undershirt to scarlet Windsor scarf to tie under
      the rolling collar of the blue blouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bath first, Bob,&rdquo; and his new guardian initiated him into the exciting
      experience of a splash in a big white tub, in water decidedly warmer than
      it would be a week hence when he should have become used to the
      invigorating cool plunge. Then Burns, glowing from contact with water as
      cold as it could be got from the tap, clad in bathrobe and slippers,
      attempted to solve the mysteries of Bob's toilet. Roars of laughter
      interspersed with high pipings of glee presently brought Cynthia to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't I help you, Doctor Burns?&rdquo; she called anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it, Cynthia: much obliged. I'm having the time of my life.
      Stand still, son; let's try it this way round!&rdquo; came back to the
      housekeeper's ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't never wore so many things before,&rdquo; Bob declared doubtfully, as a
      small white waist with, dangling elastic stocking-supporters was finally
      discovered to go best buttoned in the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. But you'll see how fine it is to have your stockings held up for
      you. Hi! Here are some sandals, Bob! Barefoot sandals, only we'll wear
      them over stockings to-day, since we're going shopping. Now for these blue
      garments I wonder how they go. Shapeless-looking things, they look to me.
      I suppose they'll resolve into baggy knickers and the sort of long shirt
      with a belt to it the youngsters of your age all wear. Here we go. Does
      this top part button behind, Bob, like the waist? No, I think not.... It
      sure looks odd, whichever way we don it, but that may be because it's
      pretty big. Harold's several sizes bigger than you, though he can't be
      much older. Give me six months and I'll have you filling out any other
      five-year-olds clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hands&mdash;they're all gone,&rdquo; remarked the child, holding out his
      arms. The blue sleeves did, indeed, cover them to the finger-tips.
      Laughing, Burns rolled the cloth back, making an awkward bunch at the
      wrist, but allowing the small hands freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Mrs. Lessing trains her eye on you she'll want to make time getting
      to the shops,&rdquo; Burns observed, struggling with the scarlet scarf and
      finally tying it like a four-in-hand. &ldquo;But you're clean, Bob, and hungry,
      I hope. Now I want a great big hug to pay me for dressing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his arms, and his new charge sprang into them, pressing arms
      like sticks around the strong neck of the man who seemed to him already
      the best friend he had in the world&mdash;as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o'clock, a round of calls made, the Green Imp came for Bob and
      Mrs. Lessing. They met him, hand in hand, the little figure in its
      voluminous misfit clothes looking quaint, enough beside the perfect
      outlines of his companion's attire. But both faces were very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many dollars do you suppose Ellen has, stowed away in that handsome
      purse of hers, ready to spend on the child?&rdquo; Martha Macauley queried of
      Winifred Chester as they watched the Green Imp out of sight from the
      Macauley porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Chester shook her head. &ldquo;I've no idea. She'll want to get him
      everything a child could have. But Red won't let her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't know. He'll drop them at a store and go off to the hospital. The
      things will come home by special delivery, and the next thing he sees will
      be Bob in silk socks and white linen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it. He'll go shopping with them. He's wild over the boy,
      and he doesn't care a straw what people might think who saw the three
      together. He'll tyrannize over Ellen&mdash;and she'll let him, for the
      pleasure of being ruled by a man once more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a shrewd prophecy and goes to show that women really understand
      each other pretty well&mdash;women of the same sort. For Red Pepper Burns
      did go shopping with the pair from start to finish. It was an experience
      he did not see any occasion for missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't mind my coming, too?&rdquo; was all the permission he asked, and Mrs.
      Lessing answered simply: &ldquo;Surely not, if you care to. We shall want your
      judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not conducted them to a department store, but to the small shop of
      a decidedly exclusive children's outfitter. Burns knew nothing about the
      presumably greater cost of buying a wardrobe in a place like this, but he
      soon scented danger. He scrutinized certain glass showcases containing wax
      lay figures of pink-cheeked youngsters attired as for the stage, and
      boomed his first caution into his companion's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not the sort of puppet we want to make out of Bob, eh?&rdquo; he
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned, smiling. &ldquo;Not unless you intend to keep him in a glass case,
      Doctor Burns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No long-trousered imitation of a sailor-boy, either, please,&rdquo; said he,
      pointing, disfavour in his eye, at the presentment of a curly-headed
      infant of five in a Jack-tar outfit of white flannel topped by an
      expensive straw hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you're not going to trust me,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Lessing, as a
      slim-waisted, trailing-black-gowned saleswoman approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll trust you, but I intend to keep my eye on you,&rdquo; admitted Burns
      frankly. He observed with interest the wonderful figure of the saleswoman.
      Quite possibly that lady thought he was admiring her, for nothing in his
      face could have told her that he was mapping out in his surgeon's mind her
      physical anatomy, and speculating as to where in the name of Hygeia she
      could have disposed of her digestive organs in a circumference the
      diminutive size of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Underwear first. Mrs. Lessing went straight at the foundations of Bob's
      make up, and began to look over boxes of little gossamer shirts and tiny
      union suits of a fabric so delicately fine that Burns handled a fold of it
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silk?&rdquo; he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, the corners of her mouth curving. &ldquo;Only a thread now
      and then. Mostly lisle&mdash;for very hot weather. These others have some
      wool in them, for cooler days. Those nearest you are quite warm, though
      very light in weight. For really cold weather&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not planning to watch the thermometer and keep him changing
      underwear accordingly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, Doctor Burns. But four weights for the year aren't too many,
      are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you buying for a year ahead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please let me. I shall not be here when he needs to change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met. Something in hers made him desist from argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stockings came next. Mrs. Lessing bought substantial tan ones in quantity,
      long and well reenforced. Then she took up socks of russet and of white.
      &ldquo;Shall you object to his wearing these a good, deal?&rdquo; she asked Burns. He
      took up one small sample, running his fingers into it. &ldquo;I should think he
      might put his toes through one of those in an hour or two,&rdquo; he suggested.
      &ldquo;His legs are pretty thin. Do you think pipe-stem legs in short socks, to
      say nothing of bruises and scratches, really attractive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want him to go barefooted a good deal of the time, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. But legs in socks are neither fish, flesh, nor good red herring, to
      my thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the smile on his lips, he looked obstinate and she
      deliberated, drawing a white sock unmistakably fine and expensive over her
      gray-gloved hand. Plainly she wanted to see Bob in socks and strap
      slippers, of the sort her boy would have worn. As she studied the sock
      Burns studied her profile. &ldquo;Get him a pair, for your own satisfaction,&rdquo; he
      conceded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not hear the order she gave, but the saleswoman was pleasantly
      smiling as she checked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing that happened, Bob was being measured. Then he was trying
      on Russian blouse suits that fitted, practical little garments of blue
      galatea, of tan-coloured linen crash, even of brown holland. Burns looked
      on approvingly. The clothes turned Bob into a gentleman's son, no doubt of
      that, but it was the sort of gentleman's son who can have the very best of
      romping, good times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something diverted Bums's attention for a little, and when he turned back
      to Bob a bright scarlet reefer had been pulled on over his blouse, and a
      wide sailor hat with a scarlet ribbon crowned his black curls. The result
      was engagingly picturesque. But the critic frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid that won't do, Mrs. Lessing,&rdquo; he objected decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't like the colour? Not with his hair and eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't hurt his hair, but it will his eyes. The sun on that red will
      torture him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it? I shouldn't have thought of it. So many children wear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shortly come to spectacles. Try it yourself for half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew off the reefer. Bob objected. &ldquo;I like the red jacky, Dotter
      Burns,&rdquo; he said. It was his first comment. Hitherto he had been in a dazed
      state, submitting wonderingly to this strange experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another small coat of tan-coloured cloth with a gorgeous red-and-brown
      emblem on the sleeve consoled him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we are through,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lessing Burns looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No white clothes?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want him to have some?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I thought you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have ordered three suits to be made for him,&rdquo; she admitted, flushing a
      little. &ldquo;They will be very plain and will launder beautifully. He will
      wear them only on special occasions. Do you mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not on those conditions,&rdquo; he agreed reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to a shoe shop, and Bob became the richer for leather sandals,
      canvas shoes, and various other footwear, some of it undeniably fine.
      Burns took one little black slipper into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what Bob's grandmother would say to that,&rdquo; he observed in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen Lessing regarded its mate. Her lashes hid her eyes, but her lip
      quivered and he saw it. The salesman was busy with Bob. Burns laid his
      hand for an instant on hers. She looked up, and a smile struggled with the
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A toy shop came last. Here Bob was in an ecstasy. His companions walked up
      and down the aisles, following his eager steps. Mrs. Lessing would have
      filled his arms, but she found the way obstructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have the train of cars,&rdquo; Burns consented. &ldquo;But they must be cars
      he'll have to pull about for himself. No, not the trotting horse, nor the
      trolley on the track, nor any other of the mechanical stuff. I'll get him
      that dandy little tool-chest and that box of building blocks, but that's
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mechanical toys are of the best, sir,&rdquo; suggested the salesman. &ldquo;They
      won't break except with pretty rough handling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's bad,&rdquo; Burns asserted. &ldquo;The quicker they broke, the less objection
      I'd have to 'em. It's a wonder the modern child has a trace of resource or
      inventiveness left in him. Teach him to construct, not to destroy, then
      you've done something for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he rather young for tools?&rdquo; Mrs. Lessing was turning over a small
      saw in her hands, feeling its sharp teeth with a premonitory finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are gauze and bandages in the office.&rdquo; He laughed at her expression
      as she laid down the saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't object to that box of tin soldiers?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly. You don't want to spoil him at the start. For a boy who never
      had a toy in his life he's acquired enough now to turn his head. Come
      away, Mrs. Lessing&mdash;flee temptation. Come, Bobby boy.&rdquo; And Burns led
      the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob, astride of a marvellous rocking-horse taller than himself, was like
      to weep. Mrs. Lessing went to him. He whispered something in her ear. She
      came back to Burns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Burns,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;every boy has a rocking-horse. He's just the
      age to enjoy it. Surely it won't hazard his inventiveness: it will develop
      it. He'll ride all over the country, as you do in the Green Imp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not costly and it's a very good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns inquired the price again; this time he asked the salesman. Then he
      spoke low:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen dollars seems 'not costly' to you, I suppose. Think of Bob
      yesterday, with not a toy to his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why I want to give him one to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll be just as happy riding a stick&mdash;as soon as he forgets this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't forget it. Look at his eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're looking at his eyes all the time. That's what undoes you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had to look away from her eyes then himself, or he felt quite suddenly
      that he, too, would have been undone. He had resisted the entreaty in
      women's eyes many times, but not always, despite the reputation he held
      for indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Burns, won't you give me this one pleasure? You've really been
      quite firm all the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was smiling, but he had himself in hand again and he was blunt with
      her. &ldquo;Bob's a bachelor's child now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He must be trained according
      to bachelors' ideas. Come, you know it's out of reason to give the
      youngster any more to-day. Be sensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They followed him out of the store, Bob's hand held fast in hers. Somehow,
      they both looked very young as they stood outside the shop window, gazing
      back at the marvellous display within. He felt as if he were being rather
      cruel to them both. This was absurd, of course, when one considered the
      box of blocks, the train of cars and the toolkit. The child had enough
      playthings already to send him out of his head. Burns drove away rapidly
      to get out of range of other windows which seemed filled with
      rocking-horses to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy, little chap?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob nodded. His arms clasped the red train but he was not looking at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the cars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob nodded. His wide sailor hat obscured his face. Burns could see only
      the tip of the small nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have a splendid time with those blocks, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the nod, but no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hammer's pretty nice, too, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the dumb answer. But the silence seemed odd, for Bob had long
      since lost his fear 'of these companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look up here, Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly the child obeyed. Burns caught one fleeting glimpse of wet
      black lashes. One big tear was slowly stealing down the pale little cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns looked at Ellen Lessing behind Bob's back. She did not meet his
      glance. She was looking at the boy. It struck him that her profile made
      the most enchanting outline he had ever seen. He tried to steel his heart
      against them both. He knew his theory was right; he now had the chance to
      put it into practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Green Imp turned a corner to the right. They were not yet out of the
      city, and at the next block the car turned another corner, also to the
      right. At the end of another block the Imp, swerved once more&mdash;to the
      right. This brought them back to the wide street which led to the shopping
      district they had lately left. With silent passengers the Imp threaded its
      way to the toy shop. In front of it Burns stopped the car. He got out and
      went in and came out, the big rocking-horse in the arms of the salesman
      who followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at their faces. Bob's was one wide-eyed countenance of
      incredulous joy. The other's&mdash;if he had seen there satisfaction at
      having brought a man to terms he felt he should have despised her; but
      that was not what he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, by planning carefully, just room to wedge the rocking-horse in
      at Mrs. Lessing's feet without encroaching on the steering-gear. As they
      drove off, Bob was bending over and gently, stroking the animal's splendid
      black mane, with little chuckles and gurgles of joy. Once more Burns
      looked at Ellen Lessing behind Bob's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're happy now, aren't you?&rdquo; he asked in tone of assurance. &ldquo;Then,
      confound it, I must own I'm paid for letting my wise bachelor notions go
      hang, just for this time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she answered very gently. &ldquo;And I'm paid for trying to be
      reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, suddenly content. Between them, the little lad who had never
      owned a toy in his life, stowing the red train carefully away between has
      feet, gave himself wholly to the rocking-horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ellen,&rdquo; was Martha Macauley's greeting to her sister, &ldquo;did you have
      as interesting a time dressing the child as you expected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a charming time,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Lessing. She shook the dust out of
      her long gray veils smiling at her memory of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did R. P. prove docile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Docile' doesn't seem to me just the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used it in an attempt at fine irony,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Macauley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, was he tractable, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was very polite and kind and jolly&mdash;until the real business of
      shopping began. Then he became suspicious&mdash;and a trifle autocratic.&rdquo;
       She recalled his look as he told her that he would trust her, but that he
      meant to keep an eye upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you get your own way about anything?&rdquo; demanded her sister, with
      eager curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen looked at her. Martha noted that the soft black eyes were glowing,
      and that she had not seen Ellen appear more alive and interested since the
      days before trouble came to her. &ldquo;Do you imagine we fought a battle over
      our shopping?&rdquo; she asked, her lips curving with merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't tell me. I'm anxious to know whether we shall see the boy
      dressed according to Red's ideas or yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We agreed beautifully on nearly all points of his dressing. Where we
      differed, we&mdash;compromised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red never compromises with anybody, so I suppose it was done by your
      giving in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never compromises? You do him injustice. He can compromise royally&mdash;by
      the same method of 'giving in.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply can't believe it,&rdquo; murmured Martha, shaking her head.

      CHAPTER V. IN WHICH HE IS ROUGH ON A FRIEND
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;RED.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you through with that rabble? Can you 'tend to a friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redfield Pepper Burns wheeled around in his revolving chair and glanced
      sharply at Arthur Chester. What he saw made him follow the moment's
      inspection with a direct question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down. What have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester sat down. His face was white. He held up one shaking hand. &ldquo;Red,
      what's the matter with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns continued to study the man before him. He made no move to examine
      into his condition, just looked steadily into the other's face with a gaze
      before which his patient presently shifted uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all the ways to treat a fellow!&rdquo; He tried to laugh. &ldquo;Is that the
      way you do with the rest of the bunch that come to you every day? Or are
      you trying to hypnotize me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look me in the eye, Ches. What have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Working like a fiend in that infernal office. If there's any hotter place&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There'll be a hotter one for you right on this earth, if you keep on the
      way you're going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose suddenly, and approaching Chester closely, looked intently into
      the uplifted eyes. He sat down again. &ldquo;Own up!&rdquo; he commanded bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red,&rdquo; begged Chester, &ldquo;quit this sort of thing. Go at me in the usual
      way. I&mdash;I think I'm a bit nervous tonight. I can't stand your
      gun-fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. When did you begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five weeks ago when you were away. I didn't mean to get into it, Red, on
      my word I didn't, after all you've warned me. But it was so beastly hot&mdash;and
      there was a lot of extra work at the office. My head got to going it night
      and day. I&mdash;say&rdquo;&mdash;he leaned suddenly forward, has head on his
      hands&mdash;&ldquo;I can tell you better if you give me some kind of a bracer&mdash;I
      feel&mdash;so&mdash;deadly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns got up and prepared something in a glass something not particularly
      palatable, but when it had taken action, which it promptly did, Chester's
      white face had acquired a tinge of colour and he could go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stopped in Gardner's office one day when my head was worse than usual.
      Had to meet a man in ten minutes&mdash;important deal on for the house&mdash;had
      to be at my best. Told Gardner so. He fixed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did&mdash;blame him&mdash;fixed you for a dope-fiend. I've told you a
      hundred times you had precisely the kind of temperament that must avoid
      that sort of thing like the gallows.&rdquo; Burns hit the desk with his fist as
      he spoke, with a thump of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to set me up for a while&mdash;I can do anything. Then afterward&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're getting the afterward all right. How much do you take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester mentioned the amount of the drug, stating reluctantly that for the
      last two days he had been obliged slightly to increase it in order to get
      the full effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you have&mdash;that's the insidiousness of the devil's stuff.
      How soon does it get into action?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, right away&mdash;almost instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Is your imagination strong enough to&mdash;See here, Ches&rdquo;&mdash;Burns
      leaned forward &ldquo;you're taking the stuff by mouth, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester's eyes went down. &ldquo;Why&mdash;I tried it that way&mdash;but it was
      so slow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns ejaculated something under his breath; the quick colour, always
      ready to flare under his clear skin, leaped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gardner gave you a hypo, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you went and bought a syringe and taught yourself the trick. Suppose
      you give me a look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like a shamed schoolboy Chester unwillingly drew forth the small case from
      his pocket. Burns received it. He opened it and took out the tiny
      instrument. &ldquo;It looks like a very good one,&rdquo; he observed with a sort of
      deadly quietness, and with one motion of his big fingers snapped the glass
      barrel in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Chester took fire. &ldquo;That's going a little too far!&rdquo; he burst out
      in wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? Thought it was you who had gone too far. It's up to me to bring
      you back&mdash;while I can. Getting this little fiend out of the way is
      the first step. Keep cool, Ches&mdash;and I'll try to do the same, though
      it makes my blood boil to think how little you've cared for my lectures to
      you on this very thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have cared. But I had no idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have one now. It's taken you five weeks to acquire enough of a
      habit to give you some trouble to drop it. You're that sort and that's the
      way it works, anyhow. I wonder you came to me to-night. Found yourself out
      of the stuff and didn't like to try to get it here where folks know you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to put everything in the most disagreeable way you can&mdash;yes,&rdquo;
       admitted Chester testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's precisely what I want to do. Put it in such a disagreeable way
      that your backbone'll stiffen up a bit and give us something to start
      with. If I make you mad all the better&mdash;so long as you don't go back
      to fools like Gardner, who never hesitate to give a fellow like you a
      sample of what that drug'll do for 'em:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do? I shan't sleep to-night, and I've got to be in
      the office to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When's your vacation due?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till week after next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrange to take it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't. Stillinger's off on his, Monday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you have yours now if he waited?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I wouldn't ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would.&rdquo; Burns took down the receiver of his desk telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red, stop&mdash;I don't want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns paid no attention to him. In five minutes he had the city connection
      and his man. He stated the case: Chester was in urgent need of taking his
      vacation without delay, but was not willing to ask the favour of his
      office associate. He, Burns, his friend's physician, did not scruple to
      ask it if it would not interfere too seriously with Mr. Stillinger's
      plans. No diplomat could re quest a favour more courteously than R. P.
      Burns, M.D. The reply was the one to be expected of Stillinger, bachelor
      and amiable fellow, who was fond of Chester and hoped it was nothing
      serious. Tell him to go ahead with his vacation, Stillinger said, and not
      to worry over office affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Burns wheeled round from the telephone. &ldquo;Will you put yourself in
      my hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you honestly think I'm such an abandoned case&mdash;already,&rdquo; began
      Chester unhappily, &ldquo;that you have to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Ches. I don't think you're an abandoned case&mdash;that's
      nonsense&mdash;after five weeks. But I do think you're well started on a
      road that it's ruin to travel. You began it way back last winter by taking
      that headache stuff in double the dose I gave you, without consulting me,
      every time you felt a trifle below par. That's why I took it away from
      you. You felt the loss of it, and you were an easy mark for Gardner's
      dope. You've grown so dependent on that already that you're going to have
      a fight to get along without it. You can't fight and do office work, so
      I'm going to make the most of my chance during this fortnight's vacation&mdash;if
      you'll give me leave. If you won't&mdash;I think I'll knock you down and
      get you where I want you that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled&mdash;a smile with so much spirit and affection in it that
      Chester's eyes filled, to his own astonishment, for up to this point he
      had been both hurt and angry. After a moment he said, with his eyes on the
      floor, but in a different tone from any he had yet used: &ldquo;Go ahead, Red.
      I'll try to prove I have some stuff in me yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you have.&rdquo; Burns's hand was on his friend's shoulder. &ldquo;That's
      what I'm counting on. Prove it by following directions to the letter. And
      begin by coming with me for a trip into the country. I have to see a case
      before I go to bed, and the air will do your head good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first of many similar trips. Arthur Chester may fairly have
      been said to spend the succeeding fortnight in the company of the Green
      Imp and its driver. From morning till night, and often in the night itself
      when he found it impossible to sleep, he was living in the open air by
      means of this device. Of walking, also, he did an increasing amount as his
      strength grew under the regimen Burns insisted upon. But for the first
      week, in spite of all the help his physician could give him, he found
      himself indeed involved in a fierce struggle&mdash;a struggle with shaken
      and unmanageable nerves; with a desperate craving for the soothing,
      uplifting effect of the drug to which he was forced to admit he had become
      perilously accustomed; with a black depression of spirit which was worse
      than anything else he had to combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the worst of one of these periods of darkness that, alone with
      his patient upon a hilltop where the two had climbed, leaving the Green
      Imp at a point where the road had become impossible, Burns said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ches, I believe, with all my care to give you the treatment I thought you
      needed, I've failed to point out the most potent remedy of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester shook his head. &ldquo;You've done everything, Red. All the trouble's
      with me. I'm so pitiably weak&mdash;so much weaker than I ever dreamed I
      could be. I can't seem to care whether I get out of this or not. All I
      want is to lie down and go to sleep&mdash;and never wake up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words came under his breath, but Burns heard them. He showed no
      sign of being startled, though this mood was a gloomier one than he had
      yet seen his patient succumb to. Instead, he went on talking in a tone of
      confidence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have known enough to apply this remedy, because it's one I've
      tried myself. If you could know, since the night you heard me make a
      certain vow, what a time I've had with myself to keep it, you'd understand
      that I know what it means to try to break up a habit. Mine's the habit of
      years. With my temper and some of my associations, intemperate profanity's
      been the easiest thing in the world to fall into. When things went wrong,
      out would come the oaths like water out of a spring&mdash;though that's a
      false comparison: like the filth out of a sewer, I'd better say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all swear more or less,&rdquo; acknowledged Chester, his head in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as I did&mdash;and you know it. I've been responsible for many a
      boy's taking it up, though I didn't realize it. Because I was athletic and
      in for sports with them, they thought I was the whole thing. They laughed
      when I got mad and ripped out a lot of language: they copied it. But I
      never heard myself as others hear me till that night I let go at the
      mother who'd ignorantly murdered her boy by disobeying orders. On the way
      home that night I woke up&mdash;came to myself&mdash;I don't know how. The
      stars were unusually bright, and I looked up at them and thought of that
      child's soul going back to its Maker.... and then thought of my curses
      following it and coming to His ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence fell. When Burns broke it, it was in a voice deep with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next words I sent up to that ear were in a different shape. I think
      it was the first real prayer I'd ever said since the little parrot prayers
      my mother taught me. That was the first: it hasn't been the last. I don't
      suppose I say much that would sound like the preacher's language, but
      Ches, what I do believe is that&mdash;I get what I ask for. That's&mdash;help
      to fight my temptations. And profanity isn't the only one nor the toughest
      one to down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester looked up. For a moment he forgot himself and his wretchedness.
      &ldquo;It's hard to believe it's you, Red&mdash;talking like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it must be hard, but it ought to be the more convincing on that
      account. I belong to a profession of materialists, and all at once it's
      grown to seem to me the strangest thing in life that a man who studies the
      anatomy of this body of ours should be a materialist. To watch its
      workings and then doubt the God who made it is sheet wilful blindness.
      But, Ches&mdash;I've got my eyes open at last. The God who made me is up
      there, and He knows and cares how I go on with the job. As for answering
      my appeals for help when I get hard pressed&mdash;the biggest sign I have
      of that is a human one. Since Bobby Burns came to sleep in that little bed
      next mine, it's been a whole lot easier to get on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deep sigh was Chester's reply to this. He had a small boy and girl of
      his own. For their sakes and Winifred's he knew he must fight this fight
      out and win. But as for getting tangible help from the Creator of a body
      handicapped by nerves like his! He began to say this, but Burns broke in
      upon him with the answer he would least have expected at a moment like
      this&mdash;a great, ringing laugh, the sound of which brought the slow blood to
      Chester's white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you consider wrecked nerves like mine a laughing matter&mdash;&rdquo; he
      broke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Burns, his laugh over, was sober again and his voice was earnest.
      &ldquo;Arthur Chester, don't make Him responsible for your 'wrecked nerves.'
      They weren't wrecked when you were furnished with them. You've done the
      wrecking yourself by breaking pretty nearly every law that governs the
      workings of the human machine. You're paying the penalty. But you're going
      to get the upper hand. From now on, in spite of your office life, you're
      going to get good red blood in your veins&mdash;and your brains. The worst
      is over now&mdash;the second week will be easier. But what I'm trying to
      tell you is that you'll get that upper hand a lot quicker if&rdquo;&mdash;his
      cheek grew hot with this strange, unaccustomed effort at putting things he
      had never spoken of before into words&mdash;&ldquo;if you'll just reach up and
      take hold of that 'Upper Hand' that, according to my new belief and
      experience, is ready to reach down to you. It's stronger than yours:
      you'll feel the upward pull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off and got to his feet. The two had been sitting on a fallen
      log, looking off over the hills toward a distant river winding its blue
      length through fields of living green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't exactly cut out for a preacher, Ches,&rdquo; he added after a minute.
      &ldquo;I hope my talk doesn't sound to you like 'cant.' I'm a pretty poor
      specimen of a chap to be setting up my own example for anybody to follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you've been setting up your own example,&rdquo; Chester replied.
      He pulled himself up limply from the log, yet out of his face had gone the
      black look which had been there when he came up the hill. &ldquo;And what you've
      said doesn't sound like 'cant' to me, Red. It sounds more like 'can.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red Pepper Burns held out his hand. His big; warm fingers closed hard over
      the thin; cold ones which met them. Then the two men, without more words,
      went away down the hill. From this hour Arthur Chester afterward dated the
      beginning of the end of the fight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. IN WHICH HE PRESCRIBES FOR HIMSELF
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red,&rdquo; observed James Macauley, junior, &ldquo;this place of yours looks like a
      drunkard's home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced around him as he spoke. The criticism certainly found
      justification in every corner. No more neglected office could have been
      discovered belonging to any practitioner within an area of many miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it does,&rdquo; rejoined Burns from the depths of a big, dusty
      leather chair where he sat stretched in an attitude expressing extreme
      fatigue. &ldquo;But I don't care a hang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Macauley looked at him. His eyes were closed. His arms lay upon the chair
      arms, relaxed and limp. For the first time his friend observed what might
      have been noted by a critical eye on any day during the last fortnight.
      The lines on the ordinarily strong, health-tinted face were deeper than he
      had ever seen them; the cheeks were thinner; there were even shadows under
      the thick eyelashes which outlined the lids of the closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, old man,&rdquo; Macauley cried, sudden conviction seizing him,
      &ldquo;you're working altogether too hard. This miserable city epidemic has done
      you out. I've thought all the time you were trying to cover too much
      ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ground's had to be covered,&rdquo; replied the other briefly, without opening
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the other fellows worked as hard as you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it. They're all city men. You've done all this city work
      and looked after your own patients here, too, to say nothing of living in
      both places at once. With your housekeeper gone home to her sick folks,
      and Miss Mathewson off on one of your cases&mdash;no wonder this place
      looks the way it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't matter. Cut it out about the place. I'm going back in ten
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are! Not going to get to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know. I might snatch a nap now if you'd quit talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Macauley closed his mouth. Presently he got up and stole out of the room.
      He was back again in a trice, a flask in one hand, a soda siphon in the
      other, and a small glass balanced on his thumb. When Burns, at the sound
      of a clock ticking somewhere, rubbed his eyes with his fists striking in
      and reluctantly opened them, Macauley spoke briskly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here&mdash;I'm going to give you a bracer. I know your confounded
      notions, but they don't cut any figure when you need something to pull you
      together the way you do to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started to measure out the amber liquid into the glass, but Burns put
      up a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged, but I don't want any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You idiot&mdash;don't you know when to make an exception to your rule? I
      admit you've won out over the other fellows just by keeping a steady hand,
      but you're dead as a dog for rest to-night and you need a stiff one, if
      I'm any judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not&mdash;for me.&rdquo; Burns sat up. &ldquo;O Heavens, man, if I were going
      to break my rule at all it wouldn't be for a drink of anything. It would
      be for a stab in the arm with something that beats your stuff all out for
      stimulating the fatigue out of a fellow and making him feel like working
      till he drops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you have it then?&rdquo; asked Macauley curiously. &ldquo;I should think if
      ever a used-up chap were justified in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't give me that talk if you're my friend. It's hard enough to hold out
      without resorting to that game. I don't need you to advise it. I've seen
      enough of that sort of suicide. Buller and Fields are both down and out,
      and they began to brace early in the epidemic. Van Horn's a wreck, though
      he keeps going; and I tell you, I've more respect for that man than I ever
      had before. He's a poseur and a toadier, no doubt of that, and I've always
      despised him for it, but he has real ability and he's worked like a fiend
      through this muss, and not all for his rich patients, either. But he's
      weakening fast, and it's drug stimulation that's done it. No, sir: not for
      mine. But I'll make myself a cup of coffee, for I've got to keep awake,
      and I shall sleep in my tracks if I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and stumbled out into his deserted kitchen. Macauley followed,
      helping as best he knew how, and watched his friend gulp down two cupfulls
      of a muddy liquid with feeling of admiration such as a small act of large
      significance may sometimes stir in one who apprehends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later Burns, starting toward home in the Imp at a late hour in
      the morning, passed a figure on a corner of a city street waiting for the
      outward-bound trolley. He slowed down beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I take you home?&rdquo; he asked, cap in hand, and interest showing in eyes
      which a moment before had been heavy with fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen Lessing looked up. &ldquo;I shall be very glad,&rdquo; she answered, as she met
      his outstretched hand and let it draw her upward to the vacant seat. &ldquo;The
      car is always so full at this hour, and I was longing for the feeling of
      the wind against my face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's cool for late August, and you'll get a breeze on the road home that
      will refresh you. You haven't touched water or milk in this
      plague-stricken district, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. Martha warned me a dozen times before I left. How are things?
      Any better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No new cases in twenty-four hours, and the old ones well in hand. I'm
      getting home earlier to-day than I've done for a month, and hope to have a
      few hours off duty. I was planning what to do with them as I came upon
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you could do nothing better with them than to go home and
      sleep,&rdquo; she advised, looking up at his face with a critical, friendly
      survey of the signs of weariness written plainly there. &ldquo;You are worn out,
      and that means something when one says it of so strong a man as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could sleep a week, but I'm not sure that a few hours would more than
      aggravate my need. Besides, I shouldn't be at home an hour before I should
      be called out again. No, my plans were forming themselves differently, and
      now that I've met you they're taking definite shape. I want&mdash;well&mdash;suppose
      I don't tell you! Would you trust me to take you off on a rest-seeking
      expedition without explaining what I mean to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a 'rest-seeking expedition'?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Doctor Burns, are you
      sure you hadn't better go on that alone? Suppose I chatter all the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;You're not a chatterer. And I don't want to go alone. I
      haven't had a chance for an hour with you for a month, I think. This is
      the only way I can get it. Will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You provoke my curiosity. Yes, I think I'll go. I've been shopping all
      the morning and I deserve a reward of rest, if you're sure you know where
      to find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned the Imp abruptly aside from the boulevard leading out of town
      down which they had been speeding. He made a detour of certain side
      streets which brought him up before a small side establishment bearing a
      sign which set forth an alluring invitation to motoring parties in need of
      food. He disappeared therein, and was absent for the space of a full
      twenty minutes. When he returned he was followed by a waiter with a hamper
      to whose bestowal in the back of the car he looked carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sped away again, Burns turned to his companion, a smile of
      anticipation on his face, to meet a glance of some apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not repenting your rash trust of me already, are you?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm remembering that Martha has four guests at luncheon to-day, and
      expects me to be there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all? Don't let that worry you. We'll simply have a breakdown
      somewhere on the road conveniently near to a spot I know, where I can
      broil the beefsteak I have in that hamper, and make the coffee.
      'Unavoidable detention' will be your apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Irresistible temptation' will be my confession,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I'm not
      good at subterfuge and I'm so hungry that the mere mention of beefsteak
      out-of-doors&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it weighs against the plates and salads of a woman's luncheon I shall
      have a great respect for you. Come on, let's run away! You from social
      duties, I from professional ones. I'll agree to stand out Martha in your
      defense. Unless, of course, the opportunity to wear a pretty frock and
      throw all the other women in the shade&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;That's precisely what Martha wants me to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then fail her and let the other women win. It's too late to repent,
      anyhow, for here's where we turn off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Imp itself seemed to be running away, so swiftly and silently it
      covered the new road leading off into the hills. Presently it was climbing
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to get where no call-boy monotonously repeating 'Doc-tor Bur-rns,
      Doc-tor Bur-rns', can get hold of me,&rdquo; the Imp's driver explained. &ldquo;I
      suppose you're not dressed&mdash;nor shod&mdash;for a rough walk of a
      quarter of a mile where the car can't go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll sacrifice skirts and soles,&rdquo; she promised. &ldquo;Isn't the air out here
      glorious? I thought I was tired when I left the city: now I could climb
      that hill and enjoy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's precisely what we'll do, then. There's a view from the top worth
      the scramble, but I wasn't sure you'd be game for it. Perhaps I'll know
      you better at the end of this afternoon than I do now. Is there a jolly,
      athletic girl hidden away under that demure manner of yours I've seen so
      far, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lead the way up that hill and you'll find out,&rdquo; she answered with a
      challenging flash of her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lodged the Imp among a clump of pines, got out the hamper and turned to
      his companion. She had pulled off her gloves, removed hat and veil and
      folded her long, gray coat away in the car. This left her dressed in the
      trim gray skirt of walking length and the gray silk blouse she had worn
      for shopping. Burns looked at her with approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Transformed by magic from a fashionable lady in street attire to a girl
      ready for the woods,&rdquo; was his comment. &ldquo;I'm glad you leave off the hat&mdash;I'll
      match you by doffing the cap. Now aren't we a pair? Are you in for a rush
      up that first slope? Jove, I'm not half so tired as I was an hour ago,
      already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her hand in his, his other arm through the hamper handle, and
      ran with her up the slope. At the edge of the steeper climb to come they
      stopped, breathing fast. &ldquo;This isn't the way to begin, of course,&rdquo; he
      admitted as they both regained their breath, laughing at their own
      enthusiasm, &ldquo;but I couldn't resist that dash&mdash;a sort of dash for
      freedom. Now we'll take it more easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They worked their way up and up among the rocks, he always in advance,
      reaching down a muscular right arm to help her at the steeper places, and
      once giving her a knee to step on when progress could be made only up the
      straight face of a big boulder. It was undoubtedly a stiff climb for a
      woman, but she showed no signs of flinching, and though her cheeks glowed
      richly and her wavy black locks were a trifle loosened from their usual
      order when at last she set foot upon the plateau at the top, she showed
      only the temporary fatigue to be expected after such unusual exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes the blood course through one's arteries in a way worth while,&rdquo;
       was his comment as he regarded with satisfaction the splendid colour in
      her checks and the sparkle in her eyes. &ldquo;Talk about rest! That's the way
      to get it! Burn up the products of fatigue, replace them with fresh cells
      full of oxygen, and you get rejuvenation. Look at that stretch of country
      before us! Isn't that worth the climb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's glorious! I've often looked at this height as our car drove by on
      the road over there, and wanted to climb it. But Martha and Jim are always
      for reeling off miles, and so, I thought, were you. I imagined there was
      nobody but myself to care for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thought you liked the porch and the pretty clothes you wear there
      better than anything I could show you in the open,&rdquo; he owned with a laugh.
      &ldquo;Not that I haven't enjoyed that porch and the sight of the clothes&mdash;they
      don't seem to be just like Martha's and Winifred's somehow, though I can't
      tell why! I've wanted to ask you off for a trip like this, but never was
      sure you'd enjoy it. I'm glad I've found out. I feel as if I'd wasted the
      summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell to gathering wood for his fire, and when she had regained her
      breath she helped him in spite of his remonstrance. &ldquo;Let me have all the
      fun, too,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;I haven't had a chance like this for four years. I
      used to camp in flannels all summer long, in the roughest sort of style,
      and loved it dearly. I could stand the tension of a long social winter
      twice as well as the other women on account of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He understood, knowing that her husband had occupied a prominent official
      position which called upon him to maintain a corresponding place in the
      society of the city in which they had lived. Although he knew her to be
      still under thirty, he realized that on account of her early marriage she
      had had much experience in the world of affairs. It was this aspect of her
      he had always borne in mind as he had seen her before. Now he was
      beginning to recognize another side of her character and tastes, a side
      which interested him even more than the other had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a pair of children they collected their firewood, racing together to
      the base of operations with armfuls of dry sticks. When there was a big
      pile she surprised him by asking to be allowed to make the fire herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll prove to you I'm a woodsman,&rdquo; she asserted, and when she had
      performed her task after the most approved fashion of the skilled camper,
      he acknowledged that she had made good her boast. As the smoke cleared
      away in the direction which left the view unobscured and the spot he had
      selected for the lunching-place free from smoke, he grinned approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've no doubt you could grill the steak and brew the coffee with equal
      skill,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but I'm not going to let you. That's my job. I want
      to prove my prowess. Sit down on that log, please, and oversee me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She watched with hungry interest while he also gave evidence of his craft.
      It could hardly be the first time that a hamper had been packed for him at
      the place in the city, for nothing he needed had been left out, even to a
      big bottle of spring water with which to make the coffee. When his work
      was nearly complete she spread a square of white linen upon a flat rock
      and set forth the other contents of the hamper&mdash;olives and bread and
      butter, crisp celery-hearts, and cream cheese and a tin of biscuits. She
      heated the plates and cups before the fire, and as he withdrew his steak
      from the coals she set a smoking hot platter before him and offered him
      the materials for seasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a crack camper for sure,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Ah-h&mdash;does that steak
      look fit for the gods, or not? How's the coffee? Clear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfect. And the steak looks as if it would melt in one's mouth. Oh,
      isn't this fun? How glad I am I'm here and not at that luncheon!&rdquo; She
      consulted a tiny watch. &ldquo;It's two o'clock&mdash;they're sitting down,&rdquo; she
      exulted. &ldquo;Martha has waited half an hour for me and given me up, and she's
      perfectly furious. I'm wicked enough to feel that that fact is going to
      make this meal taste all the better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stolen steak and bread and butter eaten in secret have an extra relish&mdash;no
      doubt of that. Here&mdash;this juicy bit is for you to begin on. Set your
      teeth into it, partner! How's that for food, I ask of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sitting on the ground opposite each other with the flat rock between, they
      consumed this Arcadian banquet, eating with the zest born of exertion and
      the open air, the sunshine and the comradeship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has tasted quite so good to me in a year,&rdquo; said she when the
      steak had vanished, dipping a white celery-heart in salt and biting the
      end off with teeth still whiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing ever tasted so good to me,&rdquo; said he, leaning on his elbow and
      spreading a crisp biscuit with a layer of cheese. &ldquo;I always think that of
      each meal I eat in a place like this, but this one seems to have a special
      flavour. I wonder if it can be the company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled across at her, the sunshine among the pine needles of the tree
      above him throwing flecks of bright copper among the thick locks of his
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the company is usually an important part of all such outings,&rdquo;
       she admitted frankly. &ldquo;I never took one before in the society of a wornout
      doctor who began to look like a boy again before he had finished his
      coffee. I really shouldn't know you were the same person who invited me to
      go on this expedition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing like it for renewing one, body and mind. Actual physical
      repose isn't often the best cure for weariness: it's change of thought and
      occupation, particularly if the open air is a part of the cure. I've
      forgotten I have a care in the world: all I can think of is&mdash;may I
      say it?&mdash;yourself! I can't get over the wonder of seeing you turn
      from what Bob calls his 'pretty lady' into the girl I see before me&mdash;a
      girl who looks about nineteen, with a capacity for good sport in the open
      air I never dreamed of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The open air would renew everybody's youth, I think, if everybody would
      go to living out-of-doors. We're through, aren't we? There isn't a crumb
      left! Now please go off and let me clear up and pack away. That's always
      the woman's part. Couldn't you lie down on that inviting carpet of needles
      over there under the big pine and get a bit of sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep&mdash;when I can talk to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Yes, indeed. I'm not going to talk just now, anyhow, so you
      might as well make the best of it. Throw yourself down with your hands
      under your head, and look up at those beautiful boughs. Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rather reluctantly he obeyed, and she could see that, weary as he
      undoubtedly still was in spite of the refreshing meal, he really did not
      want to lose any of her society. Lying at full length on his side, his
      head propped on his hand, talking in the lazy tone of after-dinner content
      which had descended upon him, he continued to watch her as she repacked
      the hamper. It was not until she deliberately forsook him that he gave up
      to her wishes. But when, having been out of his sight for ten minutes, she
      peered cautiously through the bushes behind which she had screened
      herself, she saw what she had hoped for. His whole weary frame was
      stretched upon the pine-needle carpet, the lines of his face were relaxed,
      and his eyes fast shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was far down the hills when he awoke. He lay blinking at the
      low-sweeping boughs above him for a little without realizing where he was;
      then, as the midsummer stillness which surrounded him took hold of his
      senses, he turned his head to recall to himself the conditions under which
      he had been sleeping. Only the hamper under a tree close by gave evidence
      that he was here by his own volition. He stared about, remembering that he
      had had a companion. He got somewhat stiffly to his feet, discovering as
      he did so that he had lain for a long time without stirring from the
      position in which slumber had overtaken him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Lessing!&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      From some distance away came back a blithe answer: &ldquo;Here, Doctor Burns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started in the direction of the voice and presently came upon her
      sitting on a big granite boulder, busy with a lapful of pine cones out of
      which she seemed to be constructing something. She looked up, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why in the world did you let me sleep all the afternoon?&rdquo; he reproached
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have wakened you in ten minutes more. Have I made you late for
      your work? I understood that you could afford a few hours for rest. You've
      only slept three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three! Good heavens! When I might have been spending them with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked so chagrined that her smile changed into outright laughter. &ldquo;You
      are very flattering. But I've been taking much more satisfaction in your
      repose than I could possibly have done in your society, no matter how
      brilliant you might have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not flattering, but I admit it has its practical side. Those three
      hours' sleep in the open air have put me on my feet again. Just the same,
      I want to eat my cake and have it, too! Promise me three consecutive hours
      of your company when I'm awake, or I shan't get over regretting what I've
      missed. Will you do this again with me some September day when I can make
      the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise with pleasure. I've had a charming afternoon all by myself and
      wandered all over the hillside, dreaming midsummer day-dreams. We must go,
      mustn't we?&rdquo; She stood up, her hands full of her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me some of them, won't you, while we climb down to the car?&rdquo; he
      begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My happiest one,&rdquo; she said as they descended, &ldquo;is the making of a country
      home for little crippled children. I think I've found the spot&mdash;the
      old Fairmount place&mdash;it's not more than five miles from here. If I
      can only buy it at a reasonable figure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Lessing!&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;So that's the sort of thing that makes your
      day-dreams! No wonder&mdash;well!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you be surprised? Isn't that a delightful dream? If I can only
      make it come true&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can. Do you want a visiting surgeon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. Will you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Lessing,&rdquo; said he, stopping short just below her on the steep
      path and looking up into her face with eyes of eager pleasure, &ldquo;that's
      been one of my dreams so long I can't remember when I began to think about
      it. But I haven't been able to finance it yet, nor to find time to get
      anybody else to do it. If you'll provide the place I'll do everything I
      can to make it a success. There are no less than four children this minute
      I'm longing to get into such a home. We'll go into partnership if you'll
      take me. I&mdash;why&mdash;you see, I can't even talk straight about it! And you&mdash;I
      thought you were a society woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a society woman, I suppose,&rdquo; she answered laughing, &ldquo;though our
      ideas might differ as to what that term stands for. But why should that
      prevent my caring for this lovely plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently it doesn't. How many sides have you anyhow? I've found out two
      new ones to-day. Girl&mdash;and patron saint&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don't make fun of me. I'm no girl and very far from any kind of
      saint. Please help me down this four-foot drop as if I were a very, very
      old lady, for my head is dizzy with joy that I've found somebody to care
      for my schemes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaped down and held up his arms. &ldquo;Come, grandma!&rdquo; he invited, his face
      full of mischief and enthusiasm and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'll play girl, after all,&rdquo; she refused gaily and, accepting one
      hand only, swung herself lightly down to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it's 'bracers' the fellows think they need to put the heart back into
      them!&rdquo; jeered Red Pepper Burns to himself. &ldquo;Let them try the open country
      and a comrade like this&mdash;if there is another anywhere on earth! But
      they can't have her!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. IN WHICH HE CONTINUES TO SAW WOOD
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are at last, Red, you sinner, and I'm the loser. Ches and I've
      had a bet on since we saw the Green Imp tear off just as the first guests
      were coming. I vowed it was a fake call and you'd never get back till the
      musicians were green-flannelling their instruments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew he wouldn't do us a cut-away trick like that,&rdquo; declared Arthur
      Chester with an affectionate, white-gloved hand on Burns's black-clad arm.
      &ldquo;Not that I'd have blamed you on a night like this. What people want to
      give dances for in August, with the thermometer at the top of the tree, I
      don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go along in, old man, and see the ladies. Take out Pauline. Mrs. Lessing
      isn't dancing. Make a sitting-out engagement with the lovely widow, then
      bolt out here. That's my advice,&rdquo; urged Macauley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged, I will. Wouldn't have come if Winifred hadn't cornered me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's doing her duty by Pauline, and she considers her duty isn't done
      till she's secured the men Pauline wants. But I say&mdash;when you get a
      look at Ellen you'll forget the rivulets coursing down your neck. It's the
      first time she's worn anything not suggestive of past experiences. It's
      only white tonight, but&mdash;&rdquo; Macauley's pause was eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns pushed on into the house, through whose open doors and windows came
      sounds of revelry. A stringed orchestra was playing somewhere out of
      sight, and to its music the late arrival, holding his head well up that he
      might keep his collar intact until the latest possible moment, set his
      course toward his hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, in the bower which had been made of the porch, Chester,
      disgracefully shuffling off the duties of host and lounging with Macauley
      and two or three other of the young married men, reported through the
      flower-hung window the progress of the victim led to the sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's shouldered his way to Win&mdash;he's shaking hands and trying not to
      look hot. Hi! Pauline's sighted him already. She's making for him like the
      arrow to the target.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the bullet for the hippopotamus,&rdquo; suggested Macauley under his breath
      in Chester's ear. He, too, began to reconnoiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's asking her if she saved the first one for him, and she's telling him
      she did till the last minute. Her card is full now, but he shall have the
      last half of this next one. Doesn't he look overjoyed?&rdquo; Chester chuckled
      wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Ellen? Why isn't she on deck now just as Red comes?&rdquo; Macauley
      began to fume. &ldquo;She's behaved nobly all the evening so far&mdash;she might
      have a rational being how for a partner as her reward. But I presume she's
      sitting out somewhere with that chump of a Wardlaw&mdash;he follows her
      like a shadow and she's too kindhearted to shake him. She's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice speaking softly from the lawn below the porch interrupted him. &ldquo;Is
      Doctor Burns here?&rdquo; it asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chester went over to the rail. &ldquo;He's only just come, you know, Miss
      Mathewson. You don't have to call him out this minute, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Mr. Chester, but I'm afraid I must. The call is very urgent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell 'em to get somebody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Burns wouldn't like it&mdash;they're special friends of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;I suppose he'll see the bright side of getting out of that
      Turkish bath in there, but I must say I wish I didn't have to pull through
      this whole affair without his support,&rdquo; grumbled Chester as he went in to
      find Burns, now disappeared into the inner rooms where the music came
      from.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red Pepper came out looking the name more than usual, for three rounds of
      the floor had brought, as it seemed to him, every drop of blood to his
      face, and his hair clung damply to his brow. He held a brief colloquy with
      his office nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No way out; I'll have to go, Ches,&rdquo; said he with ill-concealed joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll hustle? You'll make one more try of it?&rdquo; begged Chester. &ldquo;This
      thing won't break up early: not with Pauline pushing it. You'll be back in
      time to be taken out and fed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to,&rdquo; and Burns disappeared off the end of the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky dog,&rdquo; gloomed Macauley. &ldquo;The call's five miles out on the road to
      the city. I'd like to be in the Green Imp for the spin Red'll make of it.
      By George! I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off suddenly, gave a hasty look around and bolted off the end of
      the porch into the semidarkness of the lawn. He ran across behind the
      houses to his own back porch, procured a dustcoat from within and dashed
      back, regardless of the bodily heat he was generating. As the Green Imp
      backed out of the barn Macauley swung himself into the unoccupied seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns, also in dust-coat pulled on over his evening clothes, grinned
      cheerfully. &ldquo;Deserter?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be back within the hour, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Less than that, probably. The Imp's running like a bird to-night&mdash;show
      you her paces when we get out. Hi, there! Who's that chasing us? Well, of
      all the&mdash;you, too, Ches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panting, Chester flung himself upon the running-board just as the car
      turned out of the yard. &ldquo;Had a hunt for my coat&mdash;nearly lost you!&rdquo; he
      gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns stopped the car. &ldquo;See here, sonny,&rdquo; he expostulated. &ldquo;You happen to
      be host, you know. I might be detained out there, though I don't expect
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the trolley back if you are,&rdquo; replied Chester, settling
      himself. &ldquo;I can't stand it to see you fellows cut away out of the pow-wow
      and not go, too. I'll take my chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it!&rdquo; and, laughing, with a glance back at the gaily lighted house,
      Burns sent the car on her course. &ldquo;You two are always bragging up the
      married life,&rdquo; he remarked as the Green Imp gathered speed, &ldquo;but it
      strikes me you're pretty eager to get away from the glories of your wives'
      entertaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's one curious thing,&rdquo; admitted Macauley thoughtfully, &ldquo;that no matter
      how harmonious a couple may be they're bound to differ on what does and
      does not constitute entertainment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, a girl like Pauline always wants to dance, no matter how
      torrid the night,&rdquo; explained Chester. &ldquo;Win and I have to consider our
      guest's wish. But you can bet Pauline isn't getting her wish&mdash;not
      with R. P. Burns running around the country all the evening and only
      making five-minute stops at her side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the speed with which the Green Imp swallowed the ground it looked as if
      Burns might make several such trips and still interpolate a number of
      &ldquo;five-minute stops&rdquo; before the affair at the Chester house should be over.
      Before his passengers were well aware of the distance they had covered he
      pulled up in front of a small cottage. They settled themselves comfortably
      to await a fifteen-minute stay, but in five he was out again. Both dust
      coat and clawhammer were off&mdash;his sleeves were rolled to the elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in for it, boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can't get away under two hours at the
      shortest. Sorry. But they didn't let me know what they wanted me for, and
      I'm caught. You'll have to drive home. Call up Johnny Caruthers and let
      him bring back the Imp and Miss Mathewson. I can't be spared long enough
      to go myself, so take her this note to tell her what to bring. Get busy,
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed Macauley a hasty scrawl on a prescription blank, and smiled at
      the discomfited faces of his two friends showing plainly in the lights
      which streamed from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look blamed pleased over your job,&rdquo; growled Macauley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the job all right,&rdquo; admitted Burns; &ldquo;particularly when contrasted
      with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't say it if you'd caught one glimpse of Mrs. L.&rdquo; called back
      Chester, as the Imp responded somewhat erratically to Macauley's
      unaccustomed touch. But all the answer they got was, an emphatic &ldquo;Don't
      change gears as if you were running a thrashing machine, Mac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was two hours and a half later that Burns came out of the small cottage
      again, wiping a damp face, his white shirt-front a pathetic ruin, his
      hastily reassumed white waistcoat and tie decidedly the worse for having
      been carelessly handled. But his face, when he turned it toward the stars
      as he crossed the tiny patch of a flower-bordered yard, was a contented
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It pays up all the arrears when you can leave a chunk of happiness behind
      you as big as that one,&rdquo; he said to himself. Johnny Caruthers had gone
      home by trolley long ago, and Miss Mathewson was to remain for the night
      and return with the doctor when he came for his morning after-visit. Burns
      sent the Green Imp off at a moderate pace, musing as he drove through the
      now moderated and refreshing air of two o'clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Party must be about over by now; think it'll adjourn without seeing any
      more of Red Pepper and his misused dress clothes,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;I
      suppose those dancing puppets think they've had a good time, but it isn't
      in it with mine. Bless the little woman: she's happy over her first boy!
      He's a winner, too. As for Tom, I could have tipped him over with a nod of
      the head when he was thanking me for leaving the merry-go-round to stand
      by. It must feel pretty good to be the father of a promising specimen like
      that. Must beat the adopting business several leagues. And that's not
      saying that Bobby Burns isn't the best thing that ever happened to R. P.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philosophizing thus, he presently sent the Green Imp at her quietest pace
      in at the home driveway. The Chester house was still brilliantly
      illumined; his own dark except for the dim light in the office and&mdash;he
      discovered it as he rounded the turn&mdash;a sort of half-radiance coming
      from the windows of his own room, where Bob slept in the small bed beside
      his own. Burns gazed anxiously at this, for it showed that somebody had
      turned on the hooded electric. He was accustomed to leave the door open
      into his private office; in which a light was always burning, and with
      this Bob had hitherto been satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have waked up and called for Cynthia,&rdquo; he decided. Housing the
      Imp, he quietly crossed the lawn to the window, avoiding any sound of
      footsteps on the gravelled paths. Both windows, screened by wire and
      awnings, were wide open; he could see with ease into the room, for the
      house was an old one and stood low. Climbing wistaria vines wreathed the
      windows, and sheltered by these he found himself secure from observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For after the first look he became exceedingly anxious not to be
      discovered. He had come home in the stirred and gentle mood often brought
      upon him by his part in such a scene as the one he had lately left behind
      him. In the first wave of joy swept by a birth into a home, whether humble
      or exalted, the man who has been of service in the hour of trial is often
      caught and lifted into a sympathetic pleasure which lasts for some time
      after he has gone on to less satisfying work. Burns had often jeered
      gently at himself for being, as he considered, more than ordinarily
      susceptible to a sort of odd tenderness of feeling under such conditions,
      and as he stared in at the scene before him he was uneasily conscious that
      he could not have come upon it at a more vulnerable moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobby Burns was sitting straight up in bed, his cheeks flushed, his
      eyelids reddened as if with prolonged crying, but his small face radiant
      with happiness as he regarded his companion, his plump little fist thrust
      tight into the hand which held his. In a chair close beside him sat a
      figure in silvery white; bare, beautifully-moulded arms, from which the
      gloves had been pulled and flung aside upon the bed, gleaming in the glow
      from the hooded light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black head was close to black head, her black lashes and his disclosed
      dark eyes curiously alike in the distracting glance of them; even the
      colouring of the faces was similar, for both showed the warm and peachy
      hues laid there by the summer sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might easily be mother and son,&rdquo; was the thought forced upon the
      spectator. His own cheek suddenly burned, in the shadow of the wistaria
      vines.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened abstractedly to the conclusion of the story: it must have been
      a charming tale, for the boy's cry of regret when it ended was eloquent.
      But the eavesdropper heard with full appreciation the richness of the low
      voice and could not wonder at Bob's delight in it. He watched with
      absorbed eyes the embrace exchanged between the two and, forgetting to be
      cautious, allowed his shifted foot to crunch the gravel under the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quicker than thought the light went out. Burns made for the office door,
      consumed with eagerness to catch her before she could get away. But when
      he set foot upon the threshold of his room only the little figure, pulling
      itself again erect in the bed, met his eyes in the dim light issuing from
      the office, and otherwise the room was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody heard me cryin' but her,&rdquo; explained Bob to his questioning
      guardian. &ldquo;Cynthia was all goned away and I heard the fiddles and they
      made me cry. She comed in and told me stories. I love her. But she wented
      awful quick out that way.&rdquo; He pointed toward a French window opening like
      a door upon the lawn. &ldquo;I wish she didn't go so quick. She looked awful
      pretty, all white and shiny. She loves me, I think, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, old man. That's your particular good luck&mdash;eh? Now lie
      down and go to sleep and tell me all about it in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you going back to the party?&rdquo; queried Bob anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly.&rdquo; Burns glanced humorously down at his attire. &ldquo;But I'm not going
      to bed just yet, so shut your eyes. I'll not be far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child obeyed. Exchanging the claw-hammer for his office coat, Burns
      went out by way of the French window to the rear of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterward Arthur Chester, putting out lights, discovered from a
      back window a familiar figure at a familiar occupation. But at this hour
      of the night the sight struck him as so extraordinary that, curiosity
      afire, he hurriedly let himself out of the side door he had just locked,
      and crossed the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of all lunatics, Red, why sawing wood? It can't be ill temper
      at missing the show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the August moonlight the figure straightened itself and laid down the
      saw. &ldquo;Go to bed, and don't bother your addle pate about your neighbours.
      Can't a man cut up a few sticks without your coming to investigate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw a few more. You haven't got the full dose necessary yet,&rdquo; advised
      Chester, his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;Want me to sit up with you till you
      work it all off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's beginning to look as if it wouldn't work off,&rdquo; muttered R. P. Burns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be a worse attack than usual. How long have you been at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sawed that whole heap at the side there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost a patient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow out a tire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad news of any sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel I oughtn't to leave you,&rdquo; persisted Chester. &ldquo;Don't you think it
      might ease your mind to tell me about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns came at him with the saw, and Chester fled. Burns went back to his
      woodpile, marshalled the sawed sticks into orderly ranks, then stood still
      once more and once more looked up at the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If an hour of that on a night like this won't take the nonsense out of
      me,&rdquo; he solemnly explained to a bright particular planet now low in the
      heavens, &ldquo;I must be past help. But I'll be&mdash;drawn and quartered if
      I'll give in. Haven't I had knockouts enough to be able to keep my head
      this time? Red Pepper Burns, 'Remember the Maine' Now, go to bed
      yourself!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. IN WHICH HE IS UNREASONABLY PREOCCUPIED
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red Pepper Burns, put down that stuff and come over. It's nine o'clock,
      and Pauline goes tomorrow, as you very well know. And not only Paul, but
      Mrs. Lessing. Paul's persuaded her to start when she does, though she
      wasn't expecting to go for three days longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      R. P. Burns looked up abstractedly. &ldquo;Can't come now. I'm busy,&rdquo; he
      replied, and immediately became reabsorbed in the big book he was
      studying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chester gazed at him amazedly. He sat at the desk in the inner office,
      surrounded by books, medical magazines, foreign reviews in both French and
      German, as Chester discovered on approaching more closely, by loose
      anatomical plates, by sheets of paper covered with rough sketches of
      something it looked more like a snake in convulsions than anything else.
      Evidently Burns was deep in some sort of professional research.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that the sight was an unaccustomed one. There could be no
      question that R. P. Burns, M.D., was a close student; this was not the
      first nor the fortieth time that his friend had thus discovered him. The
      view to be had from the point where Chester stood, of the small laboratory
      opening from this office, was also a familiar one. He could see steam
      arising from the sterilizer: he knew surgical instruments were boiling
      merrily away there. A table was littered with objects suggesting careful
      examination: a fine microscope in position; a centrifuge, Bunsen burners,
      test-tubes; elsewhere other apparatus of a description to make the
      uninitiated actively sympathetic with the presumable coming victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point of the situation to Chester was that astonishing fact that Burns
      could hear unmoved of the immediate departure of Ellen Lessing. He made up
      his mind that this scientific enthusiast could not have assimilated the
      dreadful news; he would try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red! Do you hear? She's going to-morrow&mdash;tomorrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her go. Don't bother me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean Pauline. Ellen's going, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns put up one sinewy hand and thrust it through his hair, which already
      stood on end. His collar was off and he wore a laboratory apron: his
      appearance was not prepossessing. He pulled a piece of paper toward him
      and began to make rapid lines. It was the snake again, in worse
      convulsions than before. Evidently he had not heard. Chester approached
      the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The patient isn't on the table yet: he won't die if
      you listen to me one minute. I want you to take this thing in. Mrs.
      Lessing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Knocking the sketch to one side and precipitating three books and a mass
      of papers to the floor, Red stood up. He towered above his shrinking
      fiend, wrath in his eye. His lips moved. If it had been three months
      earlier Chester would have expected to hear language of a lurid
      description. As it was, the first syllable or two did slip out, but no
      more followed. Only speech&mdash;good, vigorous Saxon, not to be
      misunderstood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you try to get it into your brain that I don't care a hang who goes
      or where, so long as I figure out a way to do this trick? The other
      fellows all say it can't be done. Not one of 'em'll do it, not even Van
      Horn. I say it can, and I'm going to do it to-morrow morning at nine
      o'clock, if I can work out a tool to do it with and make it. And I can do
      that if idiots like you will get out and keep out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and was instantly lost again in his effort at invention.
      Chester looked at him in silence for a minute more, then he walked quietly
      out. Offended? Not he. He had not listened to invective from that Celtic
      tongue for eight years not to know that high tension over a coming
      critical operation almost invariably meant brilliant success. But even he
      had never seen Red Pepper keyed up quite so taut as this. It must be a
      tremendous risk he meant to take. Success to him&mdash;the queer, fine old
      boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be over later when he gets that confounded snake of an instrument
      figured out.&rdquo; Chester offered this to the group upon his porch as
      consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he doesn't get it figured out before we break up, he won't be
      over,&rdquo; prophesied Macauley. &ldquo;Ten to one he forgets to come and say
      good-bye before he starts for the hospital in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to be standing beside the driveway when he goes,&rdquo; vowed
      Pauline. &ldquo;And if he doesn't notice me I'll climb on the car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen, don't go to-morrow,&rdquo; whispered Martha Macauley to her sister.
      &ldquo;Don't let it end this way. When he comes to, you'll be gone, and that's
      such a pity just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think I would rather be gone, dear.&rdquo; Ellen Lessing whispered back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why? When Red's excited over a big success he's simply off his head&mdash;there's
      no knowing what he won't do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer him when he has his head. Don't urge, Martha. I've promised to
      go in the morning with Pauline, and nothing could make me change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a shame for him to be so absorbed. Who wants a man who can forget
      the existence of a woman like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wants one who can't? A sorry surgeon he'd be&mdash;his hand would
      shake. Don't talk about it any more, dear. I'm going to enjoy this evening
      with you all. And I hope&mdash;oh, how I hope&mdash;that operation will be
      a success!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If it were not to be a success it would not be the fault of the man who
      worked till one o'clock&mdash;two o'clock&mdash;three o'clock it the
      morning to perfect the strangely convoluted tool which was to help &ldquo;do the
      trick&rdquo; if it could be done. Part of the work was done in the laboratory,
      part in the machine shop which occupied a corner of the old red barn,
      where the Green Imp lent her lamps as aids to the task in hand. At four,
      the instrument finished, sterilized, and put away as if it were worth its
      weight in gold&mdash;which it might easily have been if it were to prove
      fitted to the peculiar need&mdash;Burns went to bed. At six he was up
      again, had a cold plunge and a hearty breakfast, and at seven was sending
      the Imp out of the gateway, his office nurse beside him. If Mrs. Lessing
      hoped the operation would be a success, Miss Mathewson hoped and feared
      and longed with all her soul. Beneath the uniform and behind the quiet,
      plain face of the young woman who had been R. P. Burns's professional
      assistant for eight years, lived a person than whom none cared more how
      things went with him. But nobody knew that least of all Burns himself. He
      only knew that he could not get on without her; that never a suture that
      she had prepared made trouble for him after an operation: and that none
      other of the hundred nice details upon which the astounding results of
      modern surgery depend was likely to go wrong if it were she who was
      responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o'clock that afternoon the Green Imp came back. Arthur Chester had
      just returned from the office and had thrown himself into a hammock on the
      porch, for the September weather was like that of June. Catching the
      throbbing purr of the Imp as the car swung in at the driveway Chester
      jumped up. Burns flung out a triumphant arm; Miss Mathewson was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, the old boy's won out!&rdquo; Chester said to himself, and hurried
      down to meet the Imp. &ldquo;All over but the shouting, Red?&rdquo; he questioned
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All over.&rdquo; Burns's face was aflame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull up and tell me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The car came to a standstill. &ldquo;Nothing to tell. The curve I got on that
      bit of steel did the work, around the corner and inside out. The fellows
      said it wouldn't; stood around and croaked for an hour beforehand. Lord!
      I'd have died myself before I'd have failed after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should have thought they'd have unsettled your nerve,&rdquo; declared Chester,
      looking as if he would like personally to pitch into the entire medical
      profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't. Just made me mad. I can do anything when I'm mad&mdash;if I can
      keep my mouth shut.&rdquo; Burns laughed rather shamefacedly. &ldquo;That's the one
      advantage of a temper. I say, Ches, don't you want to go with me? There
      are probably half a dozen calls waiting at the office. I'll run and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped out, seized his surgical handbags and hurried away. Miss
      Mathewson descended more deliberately, Chester plying her with eager
      questions as he assisted her. &ldquo;How was it? Pretty big feather in his cap,
      Miss Mathewson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it was, Mr. Chester. Every one of the other city surgeons said it
      couldn't be done without killing the patient. They all admitted that if
      she survived the operation she would have every chance for recovery. They
      were all there to see. I never knew them all there at once before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be ungenerous to imagine they wanted him to fail,&rdquo; chuckled
      Chester, &ldquo;but we're all human. How did they take it when he succeeded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They remembered they were gentlemen and scientists,&rdquo; declared Miss
      Mathewson&mdash;&ldquo;all but one or two who aren't worth mentioning. When they
      saw he had done it, they began to clap. I don't believe there was ever
      such a burst of applause in that surgery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the old fellow do? Tried to look modest, I suppose,&rdquo; laughed
      Chester, glowing with pride and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was white all through the operation&mdash;he always is, with the
      strain. But he turned red all over when they cheered, and just said:
      'Thank you, gentlemen.' It really was a wonderful thing, Mr. Chester, even
      in these days. Only one man has done it, a German, and he has done it only
      twice. Doctor Burns will be distinguished after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for him! No wonder he looks the way he does&mdash;as if he'd like to
      turn a few handsprings,&rdquo; Chester reflected as he watched the nurse's trim
      figure walk away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns came back. &ldquo;Jump in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Work enough to keep me busy till
      bedtime. If there hadn't been, I'd have proposed a beefsteak in the woods
      by way of a celebration and a let down. I'm beginning to get a bit of
      reaction, of course; should have liked an hour or two of jollity. You and
      Win, and Mrs. Lessing and I might have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Lessing! You old chump, don't you remember she's gone? Why, Mac
      started for the train with them all in his car, not ten minutes before you
      came. They haven't been gone fifteen. I begged off from going along
      because I was dusty and tired. Just got home myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      R. P. Burns, making the circuit of the driveway behind the houses and now
      turning the Imp's nose toward the street again, stared at his friend in
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she wasn't going till day after to-morrow!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came over last night,&rdquo; drawled Chester in a longsuffering tone, &ldquo;and
      explained to you and shouted at you and tried in every way to ram the idea
      into your head that Pauline had wheedled Mrs. Lessing to start when she
      did, because their routes lay together as far as Washington. You put me
      out, calling me names and generally insulting me. It's all right, of
      course. She's to spend the winter in South Carolina, but she'll be back
      next summer. You can say good-bye to her then. It'll do just as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns's watch was in his hand. &ldquo;What time does that train go?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five-thirty. You can't make it.&rdquo; Chester's watch was also out. &ldquo;What do
      you care? Send her a picture postcard explaining that you forgot all about
      her until it was too&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last word was jerked back into his throat by the jump of the Green
      Imp. She shot out of the driveway like a stone out of a catapult, and was
      off down the mile road to the station, All conveyances going to that train
      had passed quarter-hour before, and the course was nearly clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the train's smoke at the tunnel. You can't do it,&rdquo; asserted
      Chester, pointing to the black hole a few rods to one side of the station
      whence a gray cloud was issuing. &ldquo;She only makes a two minute stop. You
      won't more than get on board before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I get on board you drive into the city and meet me there, will you?&rdquo;
       begged Burns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't drive the Imp, Red; you know I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then 'phone Johnny Caruthers from the station and send him in for me.
      That'll give me fifteen minutes on the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the use? Pauline'll be at your elbow every minute. She'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Burns was paying no attention. He was taking the Imp past a lumbering
      farm-wagon with only two inches to spare between himself and the ditch.
      Then the car was at the station, Burns was out and through the building,
      through the gate and upon the slowly-moving train after a moment's hasty
      argument with a conductor to whom he could show no ticket. On the platform
      James Macauley, junior, and Martha Macauley, Winifred Chester, and four
      small children of assorted ages stared after the big figure bolting into
      the Pullman. Bobby Burns gave a shriek of delight followed by a wail of
      disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, he's turned up, after all!&rdquo; exulted Macauley, and the two
      women looked at each other with meaning, relieved glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the car, the passengers observed interestedly the spectacle of a large
      man with a mop of fiery red hair, from which he had pulled a leather cap,
      striding, dust-covered, into the car and up to the two prettiest young
      women there. One of these very smartly clad in blue, received him with
      looks half gay, half pouting, and with a storm of talk. The other, in
      gray, with a face upon which no eye could rest once without covertly or
      openly returning in deference to its charm, gave him a quiet hand and
      turned away again to wave her farewell to the group of friends on the
      platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my chair and I'll perch on the arm of Ellen's,&rdquo; commanded Pauline,
      &ldquo;while you explain, apologize and try to make your peace with us. You'll
      find it hard work. I may smile for the sake of appearances, but inside I'm
      really awfully angry. So is Ellen, though she doesn't show it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Pauline, indefinitely prolonged and repeated, with variations,
      interpolations, interruptions. It didn't matter; Redfield Pepper Burns
      heard none of it. Even with Pauline &ldquo;perching&rdquo; on the arm of Ellen
      Lessing's chair, her face within eight inches of the other face, she was
      not within the field of his vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure the operation was successful,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can see it in his eyes,&rdquo; declared Pauline. &ldquo;I never knew hazel eyes
      could be so brilliant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It went through,&rdquo; admitted Burns. &ldquo;It had to, you know. And I had a thing
      to make last evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur told us about it,&rdquo; chattered Pauline. &ldquo;It was like a sna&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't miss my not coming over,&rdquo; said Burns. He was leaning forward,
      his hands on his knees, his rumpled head near enough so that very low
      tones could reach the person to whom he spoke. He did not once look at
      Pauline. One would have thought that that fact alone would have quieted
      her, but it did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed we did&mdash;awfully!&rdquo; cried Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did I myself, then, Mrs. Lessing. I miss it now. I shall miss it
      more whenever I think about it. I don't know of but one thing that can
      possibly make it up to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it! You don't deserve it, but our hearts are rather tender, and we
      might grant&mdash;&rdquo; Pauline looked arch. But what was the use? Nobody saw.
      Even the passengers were watching the one in gray. Spectators always watch
      the woman at whom the man is looking. And in this case it seemed well
      worth while, for even the most admirable reserve of manner could not
      control the tell-tale colour which was slowly mounting under the direct
      and continued gaze of the man with the red hair. The man himself, it
      occurred to more than one passenger, was rather well worth study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's always been a theory of mine that no woman can know a man until
      she's exchanged letters with him for a considerable period of time&mdash;say,
      a winter,&rdquo; Burns went on. Pauline, made some sort of an exclamation, but
      he failed to notice it&mdash;&ldquo;Neither can a man know a woman. It's a
      stimulating experience. Suppose we try it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How often do you propose to write to us?&rdquo; inquired Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, at last, Red Pepper Burns looked at her. If she had known him better,
      she would have known that all his vows to keep his tongue from certain
      words were at that moment very nearly as written in water. But the look he
      gave her stung her for an instant into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall want to hear about Bob,&rdquo; Ellen replied, &ldquo;all you can tell me. I
      have promised to write to him. You will have to read the letters aloud to
      him&mdash;which will give you a very fair idea of what I am doing. But if
      you care for an extra sheet for yourself&mdash;now and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An extra sheet! When I am in the mood I am likely to write a dozen sheets
      to you. When I'm not, a page will be all you'll care to read. Will you
      agree to the most erratic correspondence you ever had, with the most
      erratic fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds very promising,&rdquo; she answered, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train drew into the city station. The stop was a short one, for the
      Limited was late. In the rush of outgoing and incoming passengers Burns
      managed, for the space of sixty seconds, to get out of range of Pauline's
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall count the hours till I get that first letter,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up. &ldquo;You surely don't expect a letter till you have sent one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;I'm going home to begin to write it now,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline accompanied him to the vestibule where he shook hands with her
      forgivingly. From the platform he secured a last glimpse of the other
      face, which gave him a friendly smile as he saluted with his dusty leather
      cap held out toward her at the length of his arm. When he could no longer
      see her he drew a gusty sigh and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood at the street entrance of the big station, waiting for Johnny
      Caruthers and the Green Imp, this is what he was saying to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red, you've made more than one woman unhappy, to say nothing of yourself,
      by making love to her because she was a beauty and your head swam. This
      time you've tried rather hard to do her the justice to wait till you know.
      Only time and absence can settle that. Remember you found a nest of gray
      hairs in your red pate this morning? That should show that you're gaining
      wisdom at last, the salt in the red pepper, 'the seasoning of time,' eh,
      R. P.? But by the rate of my pulse at this present moment I'm inclined to
      believe&mdash;it's going to be a bit hard to write an absolutely sane
      letter. Perhaps it would be safer if I knew Pauline Pry would see it! I'll
      try to write as if I knew she would.... But by the spark I thought I saw
      in those black eyes I don't really imagine Pauline will!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER IX. IN WHICH HE SUFFERS A DEFEAT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The hands of the office clock were pointing to half after two, on a
      certain September night, when Burns came into his office, alone. The fire
      in the office fireplace, kept bright until nearly midnight, when his
      housekeeper had given up waiting for him and gone to bed, had burned to a
      few smouldering lumps of cannel-slag. A big leather easy-chair, its arms
      worn with much use, had been pulled into an inviting position before the
      fireplace, and the night-light by the desk was burning, as usual. All that
      could be expected had been done by the kind-hearted Cynthia, who
      comprehended, by signs she knew well and had been watching for several
      days, that affairs were going wrong with her employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he needed more than could be given him by things inanimate&mdash;needed
      it woefully. He came in as a man comes who is not only physically' weary
      to the point of exhaustion, but heart sick and sore besides. He dropped
      his heavy surgical bags upon the floor by the desk as if he wanted never
      to take them up again, pulled off coat and cap and let them fall where
      they would, then stumbled blindly over to the big chair and sank into it
      with a great sigh, as if he had reached the end of all endeavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had been physical fatigue alone which had brought him to this pass
      he might have dropped asleep where he sat, and waked, after an hour or
      two, to drag himself away to bed, like one who had been drugged. For a
      short space, indeed, he lay motionless in the chair in the attitude of one
      so spent for sleep that he must needs find it in the first place his body
      touches. But there are times when the mind will not let the body rest. And
      this was one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene he had left lately was burning before his tired eyes; the sounds
      he had lately heard were beating in his brain. For a week he had been
      putting every power he possessed into the attaining of an end for which it
      had more than once seemed to him that he would be willing to sacrifice his
      own life. He had dared everything, fought every one, had his own way in
      spite of every obstacle, believing to the last that he could win, as he
      had so often won before, by sheer contempt of danger. But this time he had
      failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all there was of it&mdash;he had failed, failed so absolutely, so
      humiliatingly, so publicly&mdash;this was the way he put it to himself&mdash;that
      he was in disgrace. He had operated when others advised against operation
      and had seemed to succeed, brilliantly and incredibly. Then the case had
      begun to go wrong. He had operated a second time&mdash;against all
      precedent, taking tremendous risks&mdash;and had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not the worst. He had lost cases before and had suffered
      keenly over them, but not as he was suffering now. In a world of death
      some cases must be lost, even by the most successful of all of his
      profession. But this was an unusual case. This was&mdash;O God&mdash;how could
      he bear losing this one?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had known her from a little girl of eight till now, when at sixteen,
      bright, beautiful, winsome sixteen, he had... what had he done? She might
      have had a chance for life&mdash;without operation. He had taken that
      chance away. And she had trusted him&mdash;how she had trusted him! Ah,
      there was the bitter drop in the cup the turn of the knife in the raw
      wound. When the others had opposed, she had looked up at him with that
      smile of hers&mdash;how could she smile when she was in such pain?&mdash;and
      whispered: &ldquo;Please do whatever you want to, Doctor Burns.&rdquo; And he had
      answered confidently: &ldquo;Good for you, Lucile&mdash;if only they'd all trust
      me like that I'd show them what I could do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vain boast&mdash;wild boast! He had been a fool&mdash;twice a fool&mdash;thrice
      a fool! He was a fool clear through&mdash;that was the matter with him&mdash;a
      proud fool who had thought that with a thrust of his keen-edged tools he
      could turn Death himself aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he had tried his hand a second time, in the last futile effort to
      avert the impending disaster, she had trusted him just the same. When he
      had said to her, speaking close to her dull ear: &ldquo;Dear little girl, I'm
      going to ask you to go to sleep again for me,&rdquo; she had turned her head
      upon the pillow, that tortured young head&mdash;he would not have thought
      she could move it at all&mdash;and had smiled at him again... for the last
      time... He would remember that smile while he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up from his chair as the intolerable memory smote him again, as it
      had been smiting him these three hours since the end had come. He began to
      pace the floor, back and forth back and forth. There were those who said
      that R. P. Burns threw off his cases easily, did not worry about them, did
      not take it to heart when they went wrong. It is a thing often said of the
      men who must turn from one patient to another, and show to the second no
      hint of how the first may be faring. Those who say it do not know&mdash;can
      never know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours wore on. Burns could not sleep, could not even relax and rest.
      To the first agony of disappointment succeeded a depression so profound
      that it seemed to him he could never rise above it and take up his work
      again. A hundred times he went painfully over the details of the case,
      from first to last. Why had he done as he had? Why had he not listened to
      Grayson, to Van Horn, to Fields? Only Buller had backed him up in his
      decisions&mdash;and he knew well enough that Buller had done it only
      because of his faith in Burns himself and his remembrance of some of his
      extraordinary successes, not because his own judgment approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five o'clock&mdash;six o'clock&mdash;he had thrown himself into the chair
      again, and had, at last, dropped into an uneasy sort of half slumber, when
      the office door quietly opened and Miss Mathewson came in. It was two
      hours before she was due. Burns roused and regarded her wonderingly, with
      eyes heavy and blood-shot. She stood still and looked down at him,
      sympathy in her face. She herself was pale with fatigue and loss of sleep,
      for she had been with him throughout the week of struggle over the case he
      had lost, and she knew the situation as no one else, even his professional
      colleagues, knew it. But she smiled wanly down at him, like a pitying
      angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't go to bed, Doctor,&rdquo; she said, very gently. &ldquo;I was afraid you
      wouldn't. Won't you go now? You know there's a day's work before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;No&mdash;I'd rather get out in the air. I'm going now.
      I'd like to take the Imp and&mdash;drive to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;&mdash;She spoke quickly, coming closer, as if she understood and
      would not let him use the reckless, common phrase which sometimes means
      despair. &ldquo;I thought you might be feeling like that&mdash;that's why I came
      early. Not that I can say anything to cheer you, Doctor Burns&mdash;I know
      you care too much for that. But there's one thing you must realize&mdash;you
      must say it over and over to yourself&mdash;you did your best. No human
      being can do more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fool's best,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Cold comfort that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a fool's best&mdash;a skilful surgeon's best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head again, got slowly up from his chair, and stood staring
      down into the ashes of the long-dead fire. The usually straight shoulders
      were bent; the naturally well-poised head, always carried confidently
      erect, was sunk upon the broad chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy Mathewson watched him for a minute, her own face full of pain; then
      laid her hand, rather timidly, upon his arm. He looked round at her and
      tried to smile, but the effort only made his expression the more pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your heart,&rdquo; said he, brokenly, &ldquo;I believe you'd stand by me to the
      last ditch of a failure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes suddenly filled. &ldquo;I'd let you operate&mdash;on my mother&mdash;to-day,&rdquo;
       said she, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed into her working face for a long moment, seized her hand and
      wrung it hard, then strode away into the inner office and flung the door
      shut behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later he came out. He had himself sternly in hand again. His
      shoulders were squared, his head up; in his face was written a peculiar
      grim defiance which those who did not comprehend might easily mistake for
      the stoicism imputed to men of his calling under defeat. Miss Mathewson
      knew better, understood that it was taking all his courage to face his
      work again, and realized as nobody else could that the day before him
      would be one of the hardest he had yet had to live. But she was hopeful
      that little by little he would come back to the same recognition of that
      which she felt was really true, that, in spite of the results, he had been
      justified in the risk he had taken, and that he could not be blamed that
      conditions which only a superhuman penetration could have foreseen would
      arise to thwart him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia has your breakfast ready for you Doctor,&rdquo; Miss Mathewson said
      quietly, as he came out. She did not look up from the desk, where she was
      working on accounts. But as he passed her, on his way to the dining-room,
      he laid his hand for an instant on her shoulder, and when she looked up
      she met his grateful eyes. She had given him the greatest proof of
      confidence in her power, and it had been the one ray of light in his black
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you take just a taste o' the chops, Doctor?&rdquo; urged his housekeeper,
      anxiously. She knew nothing of the situation, but she had not served him
      for eight years not to have learned something of his moods, and it was
      clear to her that he had had little sleep for many nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he put aside the plate. &ldquo;I know they're fine, Cynthia,&rdquo; said he in his
      gentlest way. &ldquo;But the coffee's all I want, this morning. Another cup,
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia hesitated, a motherly sort of solicitude in her homely face.
      &ldquo;Doctor, do you know you've had four, a'ready? And it's awful strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I! Well&mdash;perhaps that's enough. Thank you, Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His housekeeper looked after him, as he left the room. &ldquo;He's terrible
      blue, to be so polite as that,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;When he's happy he's in
      such a hurry he don't have time to thank a body. Of the two. I guess I'd
      rather have him hustlin' rude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the day Burns met Van Horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry the case went wrong, Doctor,&rdquo; said his colleague. There was a
      peculiar sparkle in his eye as he offered this customary, perfunctory
      condolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Burns, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't wish to seem skeptical, and you certainly have had remarkable
      success in somewhat similar cases. But it seemed to me that in advising as
      I did I was holding the only safe ground. Personally I'm not in favour of
      taking chances and in this case it seemed to me they were pretty slim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did my best to assure the family that you were within your rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't blame you for feeling broken up about it,&rdquo; declared the other
      man, soothingly. &ldquo;But we all have to learn by experience, and conservatism
      is one of the hardest lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An ugly light was growing in Red Pepper's eye. He got away without further
      words. Only last week Van Horn had been helped out of a serious and
      baffling complication by Burns himself, and no credit given to the
      rescuer. From him this sort of high and mighty sympathy was particularly
      hard to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the corner he encountered Grayson. This, as it was so little to be
      desired, was naturally to be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad, Doctor,&rdquo; Grayson began, stopping to shake hands. Van Horn had
      not even shaken hands. &ldquo;I hoped till the last that we were all wrong and
      you were right. But that heart seemed dangerously shaky to me, though I
      know you didn't think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a queer factor in the case, one I felt from the first, though I
      couldn't put my finger on it. It was the thing that made me advise against
      operation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of course there's no use crying over spilt milk; you did your best,&rdquo;
       continued Grayson cheerfully. &ldquo;Pretty little girl&mdash;plucky, too. Sorry
      to see her go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns nodded&mdash;and bolted. These Job's comforters&mdash;were they
      trying to make the thing seem even more unbearable than it already was?
      Certainly they were succeeding admirably. He went on about his work with
      set teeth, expecting at the next turn to run into Fields. He would
      undoubtedly find him at the hospital, ready to greet him with some
      croaking sympathy. True to his expectations Fields met him at the door. He
      himself was looking particularly prosperous and cheerful, as people have a
      way of appearing to us when our trouble is root theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Doctor.&rdquo; Fields shook hands, evidently trying to modify his
      own demeanour of unusual good cheer over a list of patients all safely on
      the road to ultimate recovery. &ldquo;I want to express my regret over the way
      things came out last night. Mighty pretty operation&mdash;if it had
      succeeded. Sorry it didn't. Better luck next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged.&rdquo; Burns had a bull-dog expression now. Not the most
      discerning observer would have imagined he felt a twinge of regret over
      his failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind telling me what made you so confident that the spleen had
      nothing to do with the complication?&rdquo; Fields inquired in a deprecatory
      manner which made Burns long to twist his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you suggest that it did&mdash;beforehand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I did&mdash;if I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you didn't&mdash;nor any other man till I got in and found it.
      You all observed it then&mdash;and so did I. Excuse me&mdash;I'm in too
      much of a hurry to stop to discuss the case now. I'm due upstairs.&rdquo; And
      once more Burns made good his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sore,&rdquo; was Field's verdict, looking after the man who had been his
      successful rival for so long that this exception could hardly fail to
      afford a decided, if rather shame-faced satisfaction to a brother surgeon
      not above that quite human' sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the course of the day Burns met Buller. He had dreaded to meet him,
      but not for the same reason that he had dreaded the others. Meeting Buller
      was quite another story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old boy, I'm so sorry I could cry, if it would do you any good,&rdquo; said
      Buller, his steady, honest gaze meeting his friend's miserable eyes. For
      the defiance had melted out of Burns's aspect and left it frankly wretched
      before the hearty friendship in this man's whole attitude; friendship
      which could be counted upon, like that of his office nurse's, to the end
      of all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns swallowed hard, making no reply, because he could not. But his hand
      returned the steady pressure of Buller's in a way that showed he was
      grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you'd take it hard&mdash;much harder than common. And, of course,
      I understand why. Any man would. But I wish I could make you feel the way
      I do about it. There's not one particle of reason for you to blame
      yourself. I've thought the case over and over from start to finish, and
      I'm more and more convinced that she wouldn't have lived without the
      operation. You gave her her only chance. Take that in? I mean it. I went
      around there this morning and told the family so&mdash;I took that
      liberty. It was a comfort to them, though they believed anyway. They
      haven't lost a particle of faith in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns bit his lip till he had it under control, and could get out a word
      or two of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I want a favour of you,&rdquo; the other went on hurriedly. &ldquo;A case I
      want you to see with me&mdash;possible operation within a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns hesitated an instant, changing colour. Then: &ldquo;Are you sure you'd
      better have me?&rdquo; he asked, a trifle huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other looked him in the eye. &ldquo;Why not? I know of nobody so competent.
      Come, man&mdash;put that Satan of unreasonable self-reproach behind you. When
      man becomes omniscient and omnipotent there'll be no errors in his
      judgment or his performance&mdash;and not before. Meanwhile we're all in
      the soup of fallibility together. I&mdash;I'm not much at expressing
      myself elegantly: but I trust I'm sufficiently forcible,&rdquo; smiled Buller.
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;will you meet me at four at my office? We'll go to the Arnolds'
      together, and I'll give you the history of the case on the way. It's a
      corker, I assure you, and it's keeping me awake nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding on his way alone in the Imp&mdash;he had not wanted even Johnny
      Caruthers's company to-day&mdash;Burns found the heaviness of his spirit lifting
      slightly&mdash;very slightly. Tenderness toward the little lost patient who had
      loved and trusted him so well began gradually to usurp the place of the
      black hatred of what he felt to be his own incompetency. Passing a
      florist's shop he suddenly felt like giving that which, as it had occurred
      to him before, had seemed to him would be only a mockery from his hands.
      He went in and selected flowers&mdash;dozens and dozens of white rosebuds,
      fresh and sweet&mdash;and sent them, with no card at all, to her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he drove on to his next patient, to find himself surrounded by an
      eager group of happy people, all rejoicing in what appeared to them to be
      a marvelous deliverance from a great impending danger, entirely due to his
      own foresight and skill. He knew well enough that it was Nature herself
      who had come to the rescue, and frankly told them so. But they continued
      to thrust the honour upon him, and he could but come away with a softened
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go on again,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I've got to go on. Last night I
      thought I couldn't, but, of course, that's nonsense. The best I can&mdash;God
      knows I try... And I'll never make that mistake again... But oh!&mdash;little
      Lucile&mdash;little Lucille!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. IN WHICH HE PROVES HIMSELF A HOST
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winifred,&rdquo; said R. P. Burns, invading Mrs. Arthur Chester's sunny
      living-room one crisp October morning, leather cap in hand, &ldquo;I'm going to
      give a dinner to-night. Stag dinner for Grant, of Edinburgh&mdash;man who
      taught me half the most efficient surgery I know. He's over here, and I've
      just found it out. Only been in the city two days: goes to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How interesting, Red! Where do you give it? At one of the clubs or hotels
      in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the usual thing, of course. That's why I'm not going to do it.
      Grant's a rugged sort of commonsense chap&mdash;hates show and fuss. He
      gets an overpowering lot of being 'entertained' in precisely the
      conventional style. He's a pretty big gun now, and he can't escape. When I
      told him I was going to have him out for a plain dinner at home he looked
      as relieved as if I'd offered him a reprieve for some sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly he'll enjoy the relaxation. But you'll have a caterer out
      from town, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on your life. Cynthia can cook well enough for me, and I know Ronald
      Grant's tastes like a book. But what I want to ask is that you and Martha
      Macauley will come over and see that the table looks shipshape. Cynthia's
      a captain of the kitchen, but her ideas of table decoration are a trifle
      too original even for me. Miss Mathewson's away on her vacation. I'll send
      in some flowers. My silver and china are nothing remarkable, bur as long
      as the food's right that doesn't matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted to do it for you, Red, as you know. So will Martha.
      We&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks immensely. I want Ches of course, and Jim Macauley's coming. The
      rest are M, D.'s. I must be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have been off, without doubt, in an instant more, for he was half
      out of the door as he spoke, but Winifred Chester flew after him and laid
      an insistent hand on his coat sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red! You must stop long enough to tell me something about it. How can I
      help you unless I know your plans? What hour have you set? How many are
      coming, and who? How many courses are you going to have? Have you engaged
      a waitress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red Pepper looked bewildered. &ldquo;Is there all that to it?&rdquo; he inquired
      helplessly. &ldquo;How in thunder&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;how do I know
      how many courses there'll be? Ask Cynthia that. The hour's seven-thirty;
      can't get around earlier, even if I wanted to be less formal. There's Van
      Horn and Buller and Fields and Grayson and Grant and Ches and Jim and&mdash;and
      myself. I may have asked somebody else, seems as if did but I can't
      remember. You'd better put on an extra plate in case I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was starting off again, but Winifred, laughing helplessly, again
      detained him. &ldquo;Red, you're too absurd! What about the waitress? Shall I
      find one for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I supposed Cynthia could serve us; she always does me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can't to-night, and prepare things to send in, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, see to it if you'll be so kind; only let me go, for I've only
      fifteen minutes now to meet a consultant ten miles away. Good-bye, Win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took time to turn and smile at her, and for the sake of the smile&mdash;she
      knew of none other just like it&mdash;she forgave him for involving her in
      the labours she already clearly foresaw were to be hers. How precisely
      like Red Pepper Burns it was to plan for a &ldquo;stag&rdquo; dinner in this
      inconsequent way! If it had been a coming operation, now, no detail of
      preparation would have been too insignificant to command his attention.
      But in the present instance unquestionably all he had done was to appear
      at the door of the kitchen and casually inform Cynthia that eight or nine
      men were coming to dinner to-night, and he'd trust her to see that they
      should have something good to eat. Poor Cynthia!
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred ran over to consult Martha Macauley and together they braved
      Burns's housekeeper in her kitchen. The result was relief, as far as the
      dinner itself was concerned. Cynthia was a superior cook, and long
      experience with exclusively masculine tastes had taught her the sort of
      thing which, however out of the beaten line for entertaining, was likely
      to prove successful in pleasing &ldquo;eight or nine men,&rdquo; wherever they might
      hail from.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia's planned a dinner that will be about as different from Lazier's
      concoctions as could be imagined,&rdquo; Winifred said to Martha, &ldquo;but it will
      taste what Ches calls 'licking good.' Now for the table. I'm afraid Red's
      china and linen are none too fine. We'll have to help him out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They helped him out. Only the finest of Martha's linen and silver, the
      thinnest of Winifred's plates and cups and the most precious of her glass
      would content them. When the table was set in the low-ceiled,
      casement-windowed old dining-room where Red Pepper was accustomed to bolt
      his meals alone when he took time for them at all, it was a table to
      suggest arrogantly the hand of woman, Winifred eyed it with milled
      satisfaction and concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks lovely, Martha, but not a bit bachelor-like. Do you suppose
      he'll mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as long as the food is right; and judging by the heavenly smells from
      the kitchen there's no fear for that. But it's five o'clock, and the
      flowers he promised you haven't come. Do you suppose he's forgotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he has. If he remembers the dinner itself it'll be all we can
      expect of him. It doesn't matter. There are heaps of pink and crimson
      asters yet in the garden, and some fall anemones. We'll arrange them, and
      then if his flowers do come we'll change. But they won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They didn't. But the pink and crimson asters furnished a centrepiece
      decidedly more in keeping, somehow, with a men's dinner than roses would
      have been, and the decorators were content with them. Dora, Mrs.
      Macauley's own serving maid, who was to take the part of the waitress Red
      Pepper had not thought necessary, said they looked &ldquo;awful tasty now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's after seven and Red hasn't come yet.&rdquo; Winifred Chester rushed at
      Arthur, dressing placidly. &ldquo;Jim went in for the men with his car, and said
      he'd surely have them here by seven-twenty. You'll have to go over and do
      the honours for him till he comes. He'll have to dress after he gets
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't stop to dress&mdash;not if he's late,&rdquo; predicted Chester,
      obediently hastening. &ldquo;He'll rush in at the last minute, smelling horribly
      of antiseptics, and set everybody laughing with some story. They won't
      care what he wears. It's always a case of 'where MacGregor sits, there's
      the head of the table,' you know, with Red. I certainly hope nothing will
      make him late. I'm not up to playing host to a lot of physicians and
      surgeons. I should feel as if I were about to be operated on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, dear, there's no jollier company when they're off duty. But Red
      isn't here yet, and I'm sure I hear Jim's Gabriel down the road. Do
      hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester ran across the back lawn and in through Burns's kitchen, startling
      Cynthia so that she nearly dropped the salt-box into a sauce she was
      making for the beefsteak. He reached the little front porch just in time
      to welcome the batch of professional gentlemen who came talking and
      laughing up the path together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Burns has been detained, but I'm sure he'll be here soon,&rdquo; Chester
      explained, shaking hands, and discovering for himself which was the famous
      Scottish surgeon by the &ldquo;rugged commonsense&rdquo; look of the man, quite as R.
      P. Burns had characterized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven-thirty&mdash;no Red Pepper. Seven-forty-five&mdash;eight o'clock&mdash;still
      no sign of him; harder to be explained, no sign from him. Why didn't he
      telephone or send a telegram or a messenger? Waiting longer would not do;
      Cynthia, in the kitchen, was becoming unnervingly agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was served. Chester, at one end of the table, Macauley at the
      other, both feeling a terrible responsibility upon them, did their best.
      There had turned out to be two extra guests instead of the one whom Burns
      had thought he might have asked but couldn't be sure; and Winifred had had
      a bad ten minutes looking out a full set of everything with which to set
      his place. For Red Pepper's place must certainly be left unfilled; it
      would be beyond the possibilities that the dinner should end without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he has forgotten,&rdquo; whispered Martha to Winifred in the office,
      from whose dim shadows they were surreptitiously peering into the dining
      room to make sure that everything was going properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he couldn't, not with the Edinburgh man here. He's often told us
      about Doctor Grant and how much he owes him. He does look splendid and
      capable, doesn't he&mdash;for all he's so burly and homely? And the other
      men all feel honoured to be here with him; even Doctor Van Horn, who's
      always so impressed with himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem to be having a good time. And they're eating as if they never
      saw food before. It's a success&mdash;as much as it can be without the
      host himself. Oh, why doesn't Red come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn't desert a patient in a crisis for a dozen dinners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but he'd send word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at Arthur. He's hobnobbing with Doctor Grant as if he'd always known
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim is having a bad time with Doctor Van Horn. I can see it in his eye.
      Mercy! one of them looked this way. I'm afraid he saw me. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next time they reconnoitred, the dinner was working toward its end. It
      was time, for it was nearly ten o'clock, and Cynthia's courses though not
      many, had been mighty. Presently the table had been cleared, and the men
      were drinking coffee and lighting the excellent cigars which had been
      Macauley's thought when he found that Red Pepper was not on hand to
      provide them himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the influence of these genial stimulants&mdash;Burns never offered
      any others, and one man who knew it had declined to come&mdash;the
      sociability grew more positive. Chester relaxed his legs under the table,
      feeling that at last Red's guests could take care of themselves. Grayson
      proved an accomplished story-teller; Buller had lately had some remarkable
      adventures; even Ronald Grant, who had seemed a trifle taciturn, related
      an extraordinary experience of another man. The Scottish surgeon had the
      reputation of never talking about himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smoke grew thick. Macauley's cigars were of a strong brand; the air
      was blue with their reek. Still the guests sat about the table, and still
      the talk went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was interrupted quite suddenly by the advent of Red Pepper Burns
      himself. Macauley saw him first, standing in the doorway between dining
      room and office, but for an instant he did not know him. Macauley's
      startled look caught Chester's attention; he sprang to his feet. At the
      same moment the Scottish surgeon, following Chester's eyes, observed the
      figure in the door. He was first to reach it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's happened ye, lad?&rdquo; he asked, and acted without waiting for an
      answer. He threw a powerful arm about Burns's shoulders and led him,
      reeling, back into the office where the air was purer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crowded round, doctors though they were and had many times sharply
      ordered other people not to crowd. They could see at a glance that Burns
      was very faint, that his right arm hung helpless at his side, that his
      forehead wore a blackening bruise, and that his clothes were torn and
      covered with dirt. For the rest they had to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant took charge of his friend&mdash;the pupil whom he had never
      forgotten. The arm was badly broken, too badly to be set without an
      anaesthetic. In the inner office Van Horn, his dress coat off, gave the
      chloroform while the Scotchman set the arm; and the American surgeons, no
      longer crowding, but standing off respectfully as if at a clinic, looked
      on critically. It was rapid and deft work, they admitted, especially since
      the surgeon was using another man's splints, and the patient proved to be
      one of the subjects who fight the anesthetic from beginning to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chester, white-faced but plucky, stuck it out, but Macauley fled to the
      outer air. Seeing a familiar long, dark form half on, half off the
      driveway, he hurried toward it. A minute later he had all the unoccupied
      guests around him on the lawn, and one of the Green Imp's lamps was turned
      upon its crippled shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, he's had a bad accident,&rdquo; one and another of them said as they
      examined the car's injuries. The hood was jammed until they wondered why
      the engine was not disabled; the left running-board was nearly torn off
      and the fender a shapeless wreck. The green paint was scraped and
      splintered along the left side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have come home by himself. How far, do you suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not far, driving with his left hand, and faint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He probably wasn't faint till he struck the indoor heat and the tobacco
      smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's come at least five miles. Look at that red clay on her sides.
      There's no red clay like that around here except in one place&mdash;at the
      old mill on the Red Bank road.&rdquo; Chester demonstrated his theory excitedly.
      &ldquo;I ought to know, I've ridden with him on every out-of-the-way by-path in
      the county, first and last. There's a fright of a hill just there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five miles with that arm? Gee!&rdquo; This was Buller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plucky,&rdquo; was Grayson's comment, and there was a general agreement among
      the men standing round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macauley put his shoulder to the Imp. &ldquo;Let's push her in, fellows,&rdquo; he
      proposed. He had forgotten that they were medical gentlemen of position.
      &ldquo;I don't seem to want to drive her just now,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      They pushed the Imp to the red barn and shut it in with its injuries. Then
      they went back to the house, where presently Burns came out from under his
      anaesthetic and lay looking at his guests from under the bandage which
      swathed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm mighty sorry to have broken up the fun this way, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said
      with a pale sort of smile. &ldquo;Grayson was telling a story when I butted in,
      I think. Finish it, will you, Grayson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much. Yours is the story we want now, if you're up to telling it.
      What happened out there on the Red Bank road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns scanned him. &ldquo;How do you know what road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend Mr. Chester's detective instincts. He says there's no other
      red clay like that that plasters your car. By the way, that's a fast
      machine of yours. Did you lose control on the hill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; acknowledged Burns simply. &ldquo;I lost control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester was staring at him. It was not in the nature of reason to suppose
      that Red Pepper had lost control of that car unless something else had
      happened first. The steering gear of the Imp was certainly in perfect
      condition; Macauley had said so. He wondered if Red meant that he had lost
      his temper. But what could make him lose his temper&mdash;on Red Bank
      hill?
    </p>
    <p>
      They questioned him closely, all of them in turn. But that was all he
      would say. He had lost control of the car. One or two of the men who knew
      Burns least looked as if they could tell what was the probable cause of
      such loss of control. Chester wanted to knock them down as he fancied he
      recognized this attitude of mind. And at last they went away&mdash;which
      was certainly the best thing they could do in the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      All but Ronald Grant. The Scottish surgeon accepted without hesitation
      Burns's suggestion that Doctor Grant should stay and keep him company for
      an hour or two while he got used to his arm, and should then sleep under
      his roof. So they settled down, Burns on his couch, Grant in an armchair.
      When Chester left he was thinking that, except for the outward signs of
      his adventure, Burns did not look as unfit as might have been expected for
      a happy hour with an old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just outside the house Chester himself had an adventure. He was quite
      alone, and he almost ran into a slim figure on the walk. The lights from
      the office shone out into the October night, and Chester could see at a
      glance who the girl was, even if the gleam of golden hair which all the
      town knew had not told him. She was panting and her hand was on her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Doctor Burns get home all right?&rdquo; she cried under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about Doctor Burns?&rdquo; was Chester's quick reply. He was
      startled by the girl's appearance here at this hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't make any difference what I know. Tell me if he got home. Was
      he much hurt? Why shouldn't you tell me that, Mr. Chester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is home and all right. Do you want him professionally? He can't go out
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he can't. But I had to know he got home. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank down on the doorstep, shaken and sobbing. Chester stood looking
      down at het, wondering what on earth he was to say. What had Rose Seeley
      to do with Red? What had she to do with his losing control on the Red Bank
      hill? A quick thought crossed his mind, to be as quickly dismissed. No,
      whatever Red's private affairs were, they could have nothing to do with
      this Rose&mdash;too bruised and trampled a rose to take the fancy of a man
      like him even in his most evil hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she lifted her head. &ldquo;He saved my life and 'most lost his. They'd
      been making repairs on the hill and, some way, the lanterns wasn't lit.
      It's an awful dark night. He saw what he was comin' to and turned out
      sudden into the grass. He had to go into the ditch, then, not to run over
      me&mdash;and somebody else. He ran away!&rdquo; Plainly that scornful accent did
      not mean Burns. &ldquo;I didn't. I helped him get the car up. I got his engine
      goin' for him; he showed me how. His arm was broke. There ain't no house
      for a mile out there. I hated to see him try to come home alone. I've
      walked all the way&mdash;run some of it&mdash;to make sure he got here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got here,&rdquo; murmured Chester, thinking to himself that this was the
      queerest story he'd over heard, but confident he would never have any
      better version of it and pretty sure that it was the true one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I'm a crazy fool to tell you, Mr. Chester,&rdquo; said the girl
      thickly. &ldquo;But you're a gentleman. You won't tell. No more will he. He
      didn't tell you how it happened, did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not ask the question. She made the assertion, looking to him for
      confirmation. Chester gave it. &ldquo;No, he didn't tell,&rdquo; he said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone he crossed the lawn to his own home, musing. &ldquo;For a
      'plain, quiet dinner,'&rdquo; said he, quoting a phrase of Burns's used when he
      gave Chester the invitation, &ldquo;I think Red's has been about as spectacular
      as they make 'em. Bully old boys.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. IN WHICH HE GETS EVEN WITH HIMSELF
    </h2>
    <p>
      R. P. Burns sat at his desk in the inner office, laboriously inscribing a
      letter with his left hand. It did not get on well. The handwriting in the
      four lines he had succeeded in fixing upon paper bore not the slightest
      resemblance to his usual style; instead, it looked like the chirography of
      a five-year-old attempting for the first time to copy from some older
      person's script.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held up the sheet and gazed at it in disgust. Then he glanced
      resentfully at his sling-supported right arm, especially at the fingers
      which protruded from the bandages in unaccustomed limp whiteness. Then he
      shook his left fist at it. &ldquo;You'll do some work the minute you come out of
      those splints,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You'll work your passage back to fitness quicker
      than an arm ever did before, you pale-faced shirk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he applied himself to his task, painfully forming a series of
      pothooks until one more sentence was completed. He read it over, then
      suddenly crumpled the sheet into a ball and dropped it into the waste
      basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie there!&rdquo; he whimsically commanded it. &ldquo;You're not fit to go to a
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and marched into the outer office where his office nurse sat at
      a typewriter, making lout bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Mathewson,&rdquo; he requested gruffly, &ldquo;please take a dictation. No, not
      on the bill letterheads&mdash;on the regular office sheets. I'll speak
      slowly. In fact, I'll probably speak very slowly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry I don't know shorthand,&rdquo; said Miss Mathewson, preparing her
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not. Instead, I'd rather you'd be as slow as you can, to give me time
      to think. I'm not used to transmitting mediums&mdash;the battery may be
      weak&mdash;in fact, I'm pretty sure it is. All ready? My dear Mrs.
      Lessing&rdquo;:
    </p>
    <p>
      His cheek reddened suddenly as he saw the nurse's waiting hands poised
      over the keys when she had written this address. He cleared his throat and
      plunged in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This has been a typical November day, dull and cold. We had fine October
      weather clear into the second week of this month, but all at once it
      turned cold and dull. The leaves are all off the trees&mdash;Hold on&mdash;don't
      say that. She knows the leaves are all off the trees the middle of
      November.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it partly written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Well, go on, then; I'll fix it: a fact it may be necessary to remind
      you of down there in South Carolina, where&mdash;Miss Mathewson, do you
      suppose the leaves are on in South Carolina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't know, Doctor Burns. I have always lived in the North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I&mdash;bother it! Well, leave that out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I've written 'a fact it may be necessary&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, finish it: a fact at may be necessary to remind you of, you have
      been gone so long. Oh, hang it&mdash;that sounds flat! How can I tell how
      a sentence is coming out, this way? Let that paragraph stand by itself&mdash;we'll
      hasten on to something that will take the reader's mind off our
      unfortunate beginning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be glad to know that Bobby Burns is well, and not only well, but
      fat and hearty. He had a wrestling bout with Harold Macauley the other day
      and downed him. He got a black eye, but that didn't count, though you may
      not like to hear of it. He is heavier than when you saw him&mdash;Oh, I've
      said that! Miss Mathewson, when you see I'm repeating myself, hold me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't always tell when you're going to repeat yourself,&rdquo; Miss Mathewson
      objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's enough about Bob, anyhow. Mrs. Macauley writes her all about him
      every week, only she probably didn't mention the black eye. Well, let's
      start a new paragraph. When in doubt, always start a new paragraph. It may
      turn out a gold mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found my work much crippled by the loss of my arm. Good Heavens, that
      sounds as if I'd had it amputated! And I suppose she naturally would infer
      that a man can't do as much with his arm in a sling as he can when it's in
      commission. Well, let it stand. I didn't realize how much surgery I was
      doing till I had to cut it all out. 'Cut it out,' that certainly has a
      surgical ring. It sounds rather bragging, too, I'm afraid. Never mind. The
      worst of it is to feel the muscles atrophying from disuse and the tissues
      wasting, so that when it comes out of the splints it will still have to be
      cured of the degeneration the splints have&mdash;Oh, hold on, Miss
      Mathewson&mdash;this sounds like a paper for a surgical journal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns, who had been walking up and down the room, cast himself into an
      armchair and stared despairingly at his amanuensis. But she reassured him
      by saying quietly that it was always difficult to dictate when one was not
      used to it, and that the letter sounded quite right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you think so, we'll try another paragraph&mdash;that's certainly
      enough about me. Let me see&mdash;&rdquo; He ran his left hand through his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Footsteps sounded upon the porch. Arthur Chester opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, excuse me, Red. It's nothing. I was going for a tramp, and I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm with you.&rdquo; Burns sprang to his feet looking immensely relieved.
      &ldquo;Thank you, Miss Mathewson, we'll finish another time. Or perhaps I can
      scrawl a finish with my left hand. I'll take the letter. I'll look in at
      Bob and get my hat in a jiffy, Ches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized the letter, ran into the inner office, looked in at the
      dimly-lighted room where the boy was sleeping, took up a soft hat and, out
      of sight of Miss Mathewson, crammed the typewritten sheet into his pocket
      in a crumpled condition. Pulling the soft hat well down over his eyes he
      followed Chester out into the fresh November night, drawing a long breath
      of satisfaction as the chill wind struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were just in time to save me from an awful scrape I'd got myself
      into,&rdquo; he remarked as they tramped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you looked hot and unhappy. Were you proposing to Miss
      Mathewson by letter? It's always best to say those things right out:
      letters are liable to misinterpretation,&rdquo; jeered Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right there. I was riding for a fall fast enough when you reined
      up alongside. But what's a fellow to do when he can't write himself,
      except in flytracks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume the lady would prefer the fly-track to a typewritten document
      executed by another woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know the thing was to a lady?&rdquo; Burns demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's easy. No man looks as upset as you did over a communication to
      another man. What do you write to her for, anyhow, when she's as near as
      Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't she keep you informed? Winifred says Martha says Ellen came back
      up to Washington yesterday for the wedding of a friend&mdash;hastily
      arranged&mdash;to an army officer suddenly ordered somewhere&mdash;old
      friend of Ellen's&mdash;former bridesmaid of hers, I believe. She&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns had stopped short in the middle of the hubbly, half-frozen street
      they were crossing. &ldquo;How long does she stay in Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Ask Win. Probably not long, since she only came for this
      wedding. It's tonight, I think she said. Aren't you coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns walked on at a rapid stride with which Chester, shorter-legged and
      narrower-chested, found it difficult to keep up. They had their tramp, a
      four-mile course which they were accustomed to cover frequently together
      at varying paces. Chester thought they had never covered it quite so
      quickly nor so silently before. For Burns, from the moment of receiving
      Chester's news, appeared to fall into a reverie from which it was
      impossible to draw him, and the subject of which his companion found it
      not difficult to guess. After the first half mile, Chester, than whom few
      men were more adaptable to a friend's mood, accepted the situation and
      paced along as silently as Burns, until the round was made and the two
      were at Burns's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night. Afraid I've been dumb as an oyster,&rdquo; was Burns's curt
      farewell, and Chester chuckled as he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something'll come of the dumbness,&rdquo; he prophesied to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something did. It was a telegram, telephoned to the office by a sender who
      rejoiced that having one's left arm in a sling did not obstruct one's
      capacity to send pregnant messages by wire. He had obtained the address
      from Martha Macauley, also over the telephone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. E. F. Lessing, Washington, D. C. Am leaving Washington to-night.
      Hope to have drive with you to-morrow morning in place of letters
      impossible to write. R. P. BURNS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that's a fool telegram,&rdquo; he admitted to himself as he hung up
      the receiver, &ldquo;but after that typing mess I had to express myself somehow
      except by signs. Now to get off. Luckily, this suit'll do. No time to
      change, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He telephoned for a sleeper berth; he called up a village physician and
      the house surgeon at the city hospital, and made arrangements with each
      for seeing his patients during the two nights and a day of his absence. He
      had no serious case on hand and, of course, no surgical work, so that it
      was easier to get away than it might be again for a year after his arm
      should be once more to be counted on. Then he interviewed Cynthia on the
      subject of Bob; after which he packed a small bag, speculating with some
      amusement, as he did so, on the succession of porters, bell-boys, waiters
      and hotel valets he should have to fee during the next thirty-six hours to
      secure their necessary assistance, from the fastening of his shoes to the
      tying of his scarfs, the cutting up of his food, and the rest of the
      hundred little services which must be rendered the man with his right arm
      in a sling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not look a subject for travel, Miss Mathewson,&rdquo; he announced with a
      brilliant smile, appearing once more in the outer office, where the
      bill-copying was just coming to a finish, &ldquo;but I'm off, nevertheless.
      Thank you for your struggle with my schoolboy composition. We won't need
      to finish it. I'm&mdash;Oh, thunder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the office bell. Miss Mathewson answered it. Burns, prepared to
      deny himself to all ordinary petitioners, saw the man's face and stopped
      to listen. It was a rough-looking fellow who told him his brief story, but
      the hearer listened with attention and his face became grave. He turned to
      Miss Mathewson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call Johnny Caruthers and the Imp, please,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;Telephone the
      Pullman ticket office and change my berth reservation from the ten-thirty
      to the one o'clock train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out with the man, and Miss Mathewson heard him say: &ldquo;You walked
      in, Joe? You can ride back with us on the running-board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes after he had gone Chester came again. He found Miss Mathewson
      reading by the office droplight. On the desk stood a travelling bag;
      beside it lay a light overcoat, not the sort that Red Pepper was
      accustomed to wear in the car, a dress overcoat with a silk lining. On it
      reposed a that and a pair of gloves rolled into a ball, man fashion.
      Chester regarded with interest these unmistakable signs of intended
      travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Burns going out of town?&rdquo; he inquired casually. It must be
      admitted that he had scented action of some sort on the wind which had
      taken his friend from his company at the conclusion of the walk.
      Ordinarily, Burns would have gone into Chester's den and settled down for
      an hour of talk before bedtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; Miss Mathewson replied in the noncommittal manner of the
      professional man's confidential assistant. &ldquo;But he has gone out for a call
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Mr. Chester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he go in the Imp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Country call, probably&mdash;they're the ones that bother a man at night
      as long as he does country work. I've often told Doctor Burns it was time
      he gave up this no-'count rural practice. Well, do you know what time his
      train goes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After midnight, some time.&rdquo; Miss Mathewson knew that Mr. Chester was
      Doctor Burns's close friend, but she was too accustomed to keep, her lips
      closed over her employers affairs to give information, even to Chester,
      except under protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! Well, I believe I'll sit up for him and help him off. A one-armed man
      needs an attendant. Don't stay up, Miss Mathewson. I'll take any message
      he may leave for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I ought to wait,&rdquo; replied the faithful nurse doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it. Go home and go to bed, like a tired girl, as you no
      doubt are, and trust me. If he wants you I promise to telephone you. I'll
      see him off and like to do it. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There being no real reason for doing otherwise than follow this most
      sensible advice, Miss Mathewson went away. Chester, settling himself by
      the drop-light in the chair she had vacated, fancied she looked a trifle
      disappointed and wondered why. Surely, he reasoned, the girl must get
      enough of erratic night work without sitting up merely to hand Burns his
      overcoat and wish him a pleasant journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long wait. Chester enlivened it by telephoning Winifred that he
      wouldn't be home till morning&mdash;or sooner, and elicited a flurry of
      questioning which he evaded rather clumsily.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all right for him to be curious concerning Red's affairs, he
      considered, but there was no need for the women to get started on
      inquisitive questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read himself asleep at last over the office magazines, and was awakened
      by a hurried step on the porch and a gust of November night air on his
      warm face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; was the question which assaulted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sitting up for you,&rdquo; was Chester's sleepy reply. He rubbed his eyes.
      &ldquo;Thought you might like to have me see you off:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going anywhere except back to the case I've just left. Go home
      and go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester sat up. He looked at Burns with awakening interest. He had never
      seen his friend's face look grimmer than it did now under the gray slouch
      hat, which he had worn for the tramp, pulled well down over his brows, and
      which, during all his preparations and his hasty departure in the car, it
      had not occurred to him to remove or to exchange for the leather cap he
      usually wore on such trips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to a country case instead of to Washington?&rdquo; Incredulity was written
      large on Chester's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns nodded, growing grimmer than before, if that were possible. He sat
      down on the arm of a chair, glancing over at the desk where his belongings
      lay. &ldquo;How did you know I was going to Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inferred it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're mighty quick at inference. Maybe I wasn't. But I was. Now I'm not.
      That's all there is to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not? Can't you turn the case over? I'll bet my hat it's a
      dead-beat case at that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns nodded again. &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're an ass, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't expect&mdash;her&mdash;to stay in Washington waiting for you,
      do you, when she only came up for that wedding and is going straight back
      to keep some other engagements? That's what Win says she's to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't expect her to wait.&rdquo; Burns pulled the slouch hat lower yet.
      Chester could barely see his eyes. He could only hear the tone of his
      denial of any such absurd expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chester rose and stood looking down at his friend, who had folded his left
      arm over his right in its sling, as he sat on the chair arm, and looked
      the picture of dogged resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there's some reason at the bottom of what strikes me as pure
      foolishness,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;You won't do me the honour of mentioning it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Case of infected wound in the foot. Threatened tetanus. Five-year-old
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody competent to treat the case but you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns looked up. Chester saw his eyes now, gloomy but resolute. &ldquo;No. It's
      up to me alone. I owe it to the woman. It's the only child she has left: a
      girl. It was her boy I sent to a better world with maledictions on his
      mother's head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Comprehension dawned at last on Chester's face. He saw that, taking into
      consideration Burns's feeling in that matter, there was really nothing to
      be said. &ldquo;I hope you win out,&rdquo; he evolved at length from the confusion of
      ideas in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I do.&rdquo; Burns rose. &ldquo;I must send a telegram,&rdquo; he said, and went to
      the telephone in the inner office.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was there Chester heard the honk of the Imp's horn outside. When
      Burns came back he opened the outer door and called to Johnny Caruthers,
      to know if he had obtained the serum for which he had been sent to the
      druggist. Johnny shouted back that he had. Burns turned to Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Much obliged for waiting up for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a certain fighting expression on his lips which Chester had
      learned to know meant that his whole purpose was set on the attainment of
      an end for which no price could be too great to pay, Burns went out to
      Johnny Caruthers and the Green Imp.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. IN WHICH HE HAS HIS OWN WAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doc&rdquo;&mdash;Joe Tressler followed Burns down the path, leaving his wife
      standing in the doorway, her eyes fixed, on the retreating figure of the
      man who had saved to her her one remaining child&mdash;&ldquo;Doc, we ain't
      a-goin' to forget this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither am I, Joe, for various reasons,&rdquo; replied Burns, watching Johnny
      Caruthers try the Green Imp's spark. He jumped in beside Johnny and looked
      back at Joe. &ldquo;Remember, now, keep things going just as I leave them, and I
      shall expect to find Letty nearly as well as ever when I see her again. I
      shall be back in five days. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be around when you get back, with some money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns looked the man in the eye. &ldquo;Oh, come, Joe, don't say anything you
      don't mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it this time, Doe&mdash;I sure do. Me and the old woman&mdash;we&mdash;Letty&mdash;&rdquo;
       The fellow choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Joe. I'm as glad as you are Letty's safe. Take care of her.
      Take care of your wife. Do a stroke of good, back-breaking work once in a
      while. It'll help that tired feeling of yours that's getting to be
      dangerously chronic. You've no idea, Joe, what a satisfaction it is, now
      and then, to feel that you've accomplished something. Try it. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand at the woman in the door, who responded with a flutter
      of her dingy apron; which was immediately thereafter applied to her eyes.
      Within, by the window, a little pale-faced girl hugged a remarkable doll
      with yellow hair and a red silk frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd ought to be pretty proud, Letty Tressler,&rdquo; said the woman,
      returning to the small convalescent, &ldquo;to think Doc kissed you when he
      left. He's been awful good to you, Doc has, and him with that arm in a
      sling a-bothering him all the time. But I didn't think he'd do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it's 'cause I'm so clean now,&rdquo; speculated the child weakly. &ldquo;When
      he did it he whispered in my ear that he liked clean faces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letty, you ain't goin' to have any kind o' face but a clean face after
      this, jest on account o' Doc Burns,&rdquo; vowed her mother emotionally, and the
      child, her doll pressed against her face, nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far down the road Burns was bidding Johnny Caruthers put on more speed.
      &ldquo;We have to make time to-day, Johnny,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I'm going to get off
      on that ten-thirty to-night if I have to break my other arm to do it. I
      don't know that I'd be much more helpless than I am now if I did. Curious,
      Johnny, how many things there are a man can't do with one hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say you could do more with that left hand of yours than most
      folks can with both,&rdquo; declared young Caruthers, honest admiration in his
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns laughed&mdash;a hearty, care-free laugh. He was in wild spirits,
      Johnny could see that, and wondered why the Doctor should be so happy over
      pulling a dead-beat family out of their troubles. Everybody knew Joe
      Tressler. And Johnny understood that the Doctor had given up going away on
      Joe's account ten days ago, when he took the case on the eve of his
      departure. Johnny had seen his employer in all stages of tension since
      that day, as he had driven him out, at first half-a-dozen times in the
      twenty-four hours, to this same little old wreck of a house. Johnny had
      driven him to other houses, also to one especially, in the city, where the
      lad had sat and speculated much on the extremes of experience in the life
      of a busy practitioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to this same house that Johnny took Burns next; a house reached by
      a long drive through wonderful grounds, to a palace of a home within which
      the man with his arm in the sling disappeared with precisely the same
      rather brusque and hurried bearing characteristic of him everywhere. But
      Johnny could not see within. If he had, his honest eyes might have opened
      still wider.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way upstairs Burns was intercepted by the master of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've decided to go with us, Doctor Burns, I hope?&rdquo; The question was put
      in the fashion of a person who expects but one answer. But the answer
      proved to be not that one expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, but I can't do it, Mr. Walworth.&rdquo; Burns's left hand, in the
      cordial grip which expresses hearty liking, was retained while William
      Walworth, who was accustomed to be able to arrange all things to his
      pleasure by the simple expedient of paying whatever it might cost, stared
      into the bright hazel eyes which met his with their usual straightforward
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't'! But you must, my dear Doctor, Pardon me, but I feel that no
      ordinary considerations can be allowed to stand in the way. My daughter
      needs your care on this journey. Her mother and I have agreed that her
      wish to have you with us must be fulfilled. It's an essential factor in
      her recovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not essential at all, Mr. Walworth. Miss Evelyn is well started on
      the road to full health; she has only to keep on. My going with you would
      be a mere matter of pleasing her, and that's not in the least necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His smile softened the words which struck upon the ear of the magnate with
      an unaccustomed sound. Mr. Walworth released Burns's hand, his manner
      stiffening slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must differ with you, Doctor. I feel that at this stage Evelyn's
      pleasure is a thing to be planned for. She has taken this fancy to have
      you with us on the Mediterranean cruise. We'll agree to land you and send
      you home at the end of a couple of months if you positively feel that you
      can't neglect your practice longer. But let me remind you, Doctor, that
      your fee will be made to cover all possible income from your practice
      during that time, and&mdash;I shall not be contented to measure its size
      by that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Burns's turn to stiffen within, if he did not let it show
      outwardly. He spoke positively and finally. Even William Walworth saw that
      it would be of no use to urge a man who said quite quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've thought it over, as I promised you, and decided against it. I assure
      you I appreciate the honour you would do me, and I should immensely like
      the experience. But I know my going is not necessary to Miss Evelyn's
      recovery, and that's the only thing that could make me hesitate. I'll go
      up and see her at once, if you will forgive my haste. I have a busy day
      before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Walworth looked after him as he ran up the stately staircase, and
      his thoughts were somewhat as Johnny Caruthers's had been. &ldquo;He's more of a
      man, crippled like that, than any I know. I wonder why he won't go. I
      wonder. But he won't, that's settled. Now to appease Evelyn. He'll not
      find that so easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns did not find it easy. He sat down beside the convalescent, a patient
      who had everything on her side with which to win her chosen physician's
      consent to stay by her till she should be in the possession once more of
      the blooming beauty which had made her one of the envied of the earth. He
      told her, in the direct manner he had used with her father, that he could
      not fall in with their plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came away he was tingling all over. It had been so plain. She had
      tried to disguise it, but she was where she could not run to cover, and he
      had seen it all. It gave him no pleasure: he was not that sort. He was
      sorry for the girl, but he was not in the least anxious about her. She
      would get over it; it was not his fault&mdash;he was conscience-clear on
      that. If ever he had been coolly&mdash;however kindly&mdash;professional
      in his bearing it had been in this home of great wealth, where it would
      have gone against his inmost grain to have seemed to court liking. If
      anything, his orders had been more curt, his concessions fewer, his whole
      treatment of the case on simpler lines than it might have been in almost
      any less pretentious home with which he was familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran down the stone steps in eager haste to be gone, his vision still
      engaged with the reproachful look Evelyn's mother had given him when she
      heard of his incredible refusal to accompany the Walworths on the
      luxuriously-equipped expedition in search of recuperation and enjoyment
      for the idolized only daughter. &ldquo;This settles me with them to the end of
      time, I suppose,&rdquo; he said to himself. As the car ran down the drive, he
      straightened his shoulders with a sense of thankfulness that his practice
      was not often in the homes of the comparatively few people who can afford
      to buy even that most precious of commodities, the time of others, when
      that time has been consecrated to certain uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not going to stop for lunch, Doctor?&rdquo; inquired young Caruthers anxiously,
      as the round of calls went on and one o'clock passed, with the Imp in a
      portion of the city remote from the hotel at which Burns was accustomed to
      refresh himself and Johnny when home was out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll go to the hospital next, and I shall be there a couple of hours.
      You can go and fill up then. I must be back at the office by four&mdash;for
      engagements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the day went. The busy physician who goes out of town for even a five
      days' vacation must plan for it and do much arranging in various ways. In
      spite of the fact that it would still be many weeks before Burns could
      attempt surgery again, he was having plenty to do. Only the determination
      to get away this time without fail made it possible for him to go. But
      there would be never a time when he could better be spared, and he meant
      to let nothing hinder his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The arm's coming on well,&rdquo; was Doctor Buller's verdict late that
      afternoon as he gave the healing member its usual manipulation and
      massage. &ldquo;It takes patience to wait, though, doesn't it, Burns? Never
      tried a broken arm myself, but I should say that hand must be itching to
      be at work in the operating-room again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Itching! It's burning, blistering, scarifying! I never knew how I liked
      that part of my work till I had to come down to an exclusive practice in
      pills and plasters. Grayson's doing a stunt to-day that would have driven
      me mad with envy if I could have stopped to look on. Doing it cleverly,
      too, by the report I had from Van Horn just now. When Van takes the
      trouble to praise another man it means something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Means it's been forced from him,&rdquo; commented Buller. &ldquo;Besides, Van enjoys
      praising Grayson to you. He's enjoyed your smashed arm, too, the old
      fraud. Was he ever so decent to you before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns laughed. &ldquo;You can't strike fire that way today,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Hold
      on! You're not going to put that arm back into the splints?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am. It lacks two days yet off the shortest modern regulation
      period. Come on here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave 'em off. I'll take the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be foolish, man. If I had my way I'd keep the thing put up another
      full week. I'm not an advocate of this hurry business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. The arm's well enough to come out. I'll wear it in a sling, but I
      want my coat sleeve on, and I'm going to have it on. Fix me up, will you?
      I'm in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going on a journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Get busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the very reason why you should keep that arm out of danger till
      you get back. Jostling round in a crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this my arm or yours?&rdquo; thundered Burns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buller laughed. &ldquo;Don't knock me down with it, Pepper-pot. It may be your
      arm, but you're my patient, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you fool yourself. If you won't fix me up I'll go out with it
      hanging, I can judge my own condition. Will you dress me and put any arm
      in this sling here, or must I send for Grayson? He's none of your idiotic
      conservatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet, and I'll make you look pretty, little boy. I see&mdash;these
      are new clothes just home from the tailor, and they're an elegant fit.
      Bully fresh scarf, peach of a pin, brand-new black silk sling&mdash;Oh, I
      say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For with his good left arm Burns was threatening his professional friend
      in a way that looked ominous. But a laugh was in his eye, now that he had
      got his way, and the altercation ended in a fire of jokes. Then Burns
      stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a jewel, Buller boy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You've brought me through in great
      shape. It was a nasty fracture, and you've given me an arm that'll be as
      good as new. I'm grateful&mdash;you know that. Now, if you'll look over
      that list I gave you of cases here in the city, and go out once to take a
      look at Letty Tressler, I'll be ever faithfully yours. Griggs'll see to my
      village practice. Now I'm off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope you enjoy your trip. Must be a concentrated pleasure, to be crammed
      into five days and still make you look like a schoolboy just let out,&rdquo;
       observed Buller as Burns turned, with his band on the door-knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dose doesn't have to be big to be powerful,&rdquo; rejoined Burns, opening
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nitro-glycerin, eh?&rdquo; Buller called after the departing bulk of his
      friend. &ldquo;Don't let it carry you too far up. You might come down with a
      thud!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's right enough there,&rdquo; was what Burns murmured to himself as he caught
      the elevator in the great building in which Buller's office was a crowded
      corner. &ldquo;I may come down in just that style. But better that than any more
      of this dead level of suspense. I don't think I could stand that one more
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He and Johnny Caruthers whirled home in the Imp to find Burns's village
      office as crowded as Buller's city one. It was late before he could get
      his dinner, and after it he was kept busy turning calls over to other men.
      It was the usual experience to have work pile up during the last hours, as
      if Fate were against his breaking his chains and meant to tie him hand and
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to get out of this right now,&rdquo; he announced suddenly to Miss
      Mathewson an hour before train time, as he turned away from a siege over
      the telephone with one hysterical lady who felt that her life depended
      upon his remaining to see her through an attack of indigestion. &ldquo;If I
      don't, something will come in that will pull hard to keep me home, and I'm
      not going to be kept. I'll trust you not to look me up for the next hour,
      for I'll not tell you where I'm going, and you can't guess, you know.
      Good-bye. Be a good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrung her hand, looking at her with that warmth of friendliness which
      he was accustomed, when in the mood, to bestow on her, recognizing how
      invaluable she was to him, and never once recking what it meant to her to
      be so closely associated with him. She answered in her usual quiet way,
      wishing him a safe journey and bidding him be very careful of the arm, no
      longer protected except by the silken sign that injury had been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a crowd, you know, they won't notice the sling,&rdquo; she warned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't they? Well, if my trusty left can't protect my battered right I've
      forgotten my boxing tricks. Don't be anxious about that, little friend.
      See that Amy Mathewson has a good time in my absence, will you? She's
      looking just a bit worn, to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, but her eyes did not meet his: she dared not let them. With
      all his kindness to her he did not often speak with the real affection
      which was in his voice now. She understood that he was, for some reason,
      keyed high over his prospective journey even higher than he had been ten
      days before when on the point of leaving. And she knew well enough where
      he was going, though he had not told her. It would have taken thirty-six
      hours to go to Washington, spend a brief time there and return. It was
      going to take five days to go to South Carolina, remain long enough to
      transact his business&mdash;was it business?&mdash;and come back. And
      there had been no more attempts to write letters by way of an amanuensis.
      The affection for his assistant in his manner to her was genuine, she did
      not doubt that, but it did not deceive her for a moment. So, she did not
      let her eyes meet his. They rested, instead, on the scarfpin which Buller
      had termed a &ldquo;peach,&rdquo; but they did not see it. She could not remember when
      it had been so hard to maintain that quiet control of herself which had
      long since made her employer cease to reckon with the possibilities of
      fire beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      R. P. Burns stole away with Johnny and the Imp, without so much as letting
      his neighbours know of his intentions. He had made sure that they were all
      well; that no incipient scarlet fever or invading measles was threatening
      them. He smiled to himself as the car went past the Chester house, to
      think how interested they would be to know where he was going. But he got
      safely off and nobody opened a door at sound of the Imp to call to him to
      come in a minute because somebody seemed not quite well.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, after all, he ran upon Arthur Chester&mdash;and at the city
      station, to which he had taken the precaution to go, although the
      ten-thirty stopped for a half-minute at the village. It must be admitted
      that he tried to dodge his best friend, but he did not succeed. His
      shoulders were too conspicuous: he could not get away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to see an out-of-town patient at this hour of night?&rdquo; queried
      Chester, coming up warmly interested, as best friends have a trick of
      being, in spite of all that can be done to avert their curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where else would I be going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know where else, but I doubt if it's to see a patient. There's an
      air about you that's not professional. You&mdash;er&mdash;you can't be
      going to Washington? There's nobody there now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only a few Government officials and some odds and ends of hangers-on.
      To be sure, Congress is in session, but there's nobody there. My train's
      been called, Ches; so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me carry your bag.&rdquo; Chester reached for it. &ldquo;I say, this isn't a
      tool-kit&mdash;this is a stunner of a regulation travelling bag. See here,
      Red,&rdquo; he was rushing along on the other's side, fairly running to keep up
      with Burns's strides&mdash;&ldquo;how long are you going to be gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long enough to get a change of air. The atmosphere's heavy here with
      inquisitive people who call themselves your friends. See here, Ches,
      you're not looking well. You need rest and sleep. Go home and go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're always telling me to go home and go to bed. Not till I see which
      train you take,&rdquo; panted Chester, his eyes sparkling. &ldquo;Ha! Going to turn in
      at Number Four gate, are you? Sorry I can't take your bag inside. Well,
      possibly I can guess your destination. Got your section clear through to
      South Carolina? I say, keep your head, old man, keep your head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns turned about, shook his fist at Arthur Chester, seized his bag,
      rushed through the gateway and boarded the last of the long string of
      Pullmans. On the platform he pulled off his hat and waved it at his
      friend. He could forgive anybody for anything tonight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. IN WHICH HE MAKES NO EVENING CALL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Burns opened the white gate&mdash;it was sagging a little on its hinges&mdash;and
      walked up the moss-grown path between the rows of liveoaks to the
      tall-columned portico of the still stately, if somewhat timeworn and
      decayed, mansion among the shrubbery. It was just at dusk, and far away
      somewhere a whippoorwill was calling. It was the only sound on the quiet
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened by an old negro servant, who hesitated over his answer
      to the question put by this unknown person looming up before him with his
      arm in a sling. Mrs. Elmore was in, but she was not well and could not see
      any visitors this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. Lessing in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas, Sah, she is. But she done tole me she couldn't see nobody herse'f.
      She tekkin' cah ob Miss Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns produced his card and made a persuasive request. The old darky led
      the way to a long, nearly dark apartment, where the scent of roses mingled
      with the peculiar odour of old mahogany and ancient rugs and hangings. The
      servant lit a tall, antique lamp with crystal pendants hanging from its
      shade, the light from which fell upon a bowlful of crimson roses so that
      they glowed richly. He left Burns, departing with a shuffling step and an
      air of grudging the strange gentleman the occupancy of the room, although
      it was to be for only so long as it would take to bring back word that
      neither of the ladies would see him to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns sat still for the space of two minutes then, as no further sound
      could be heard in the quiet house, he became restless. His pulses beat
      rather heavily and, to quiet them or the sense of them, he got up and
      walked about, pausing at one of the long French windows to gaze out into
      the dusky labyrinth of a garden, where he could just make out paths
      winding about among the bushes. The night was mild, and the window stood
      ajar as if some one had lately come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned and saw her. She had almost reached him, but he had not
      heard her, her footfall upon the old Turkey carpet with its faded roses
      and lilies had been so light. She was in white, and the light from the old
      lamp shone on her arms end face and brought out the shadows of her hair
      and eyes. She put out both hands&mdash;then quickly drew back one as her
      glance fell upon the sling, and gave him her left, smiling. But he drew
      the arm that had been broken out of its support and held it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take this hand, too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will be its first experience
      and, perhaps, it will put new life into it. It's pretty limp yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid hers in it very gently, looking down at it as his fingers closed
      slowly over hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's doing very well, I should think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It's barely time for
      it to be independent yet, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About time. I had something of a wrestle with Doctor Buller to get him to
      leave the splints off. How warm and soft your hand is. This one of mine
      has forgotten how the touch of another hand feels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure you ought not to use it yet. Please put it back in the sling.&rdquo;
       She drew her own hand gently away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to him that while he had been absent from her he had not been
      able to recall half her charm, and that if he had he would never have been
      able to wait half so long before pursuing her down into this Southern
      haunt of hers. He drew a full, contented breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am face to face with you. It's worth the journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the lamplight it seemed to him the rose cast a reflection on her face
      which he had not observed at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so sorry Aunt Lucy isn't able to see you tonight,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;unless
      she would consent go see you professionally. She really ought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up his hand &ldquo;Not unless she is in serious straits, please,&rdquo; he
      begged. &ldquo;I've fled from patients, only to find them all the way down on
      the train. I don't know what there can be about me to suggest to a
      conductor that I'm the man he's looking for to attend some emergency case,
      but he seems to spot me. Only at the station before this did I get
      released from the last of the series. Let me forget my profession for a
      bit if I can, just now I'm only a man who's come a long way to see you. Is
      it really you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned forward, studying her intently. His head, with its coppery
      thatch of heavy hair, showed powerful lines in the lamplight; beneath his
      dark throws the hazel eyes glowed black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's certainly I,&rdquo; she answered lightly. &ldquo;And being I, with the mistress
      of the house prevented from showing you hospitality, I must offer it. She
      begged me to make you comfortable and to tell you she would see you in the
      morning. You've had a long journey. You must want the comfort of a room
      and hot water. I'll ring for Old Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the room and pulled an old-fashioned bell-cord, upon which a
      bell was heard to jangle far away. The old darky reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have gone to a hotel,&rdquo; Burns said, &ldquo;if I could have found one in
      the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is none. And if there had been Aunt Lucy would have been much hurt
      to have you go there. Where did you leave your bag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the station. I can stay only for a night and a day, so it's a small
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send Young Sam for it. Now let Sam take you to your room, and in a
      few minutes I'll give you supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't bother about supper at this hour. I only want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want what you are to have,&mdash;some of Sue's delicious Southern
      cookery.&rdquo; She smiled at him as he looked back at her, following the old
      servant. &ldquo;She's been in the family for forty years and she loves to have
      company to appreciate her dishes. Sam, you are to help Doctor Burns. He
      has had a broken arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Burns came down, fresh from a bath and comfortable with clean linen,
      he smelled odours which made him realize that, eager as he was for other
      things, he was human enough to be intensely hungry with a healthy man's
      appetite. So he surrendered himself to the fortunes that now befell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sam conducted him to the dining-room, a quaintly attractive apartment
      where candle-light illumined the bare mahogany of the round table laid
      with a large square of linen at his place and set with delicate ancient
      china and silver. Ellen Lessing was already there in a high-backed chair
      opposite the one set for him, a figure to which his eyes were again drawn
      irresistibly and upon which they continued to rest as he took his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam disappeared toward the kitchen, and Burns spoke in a low voice across
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel as if I were in a dream,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Forty-eight hours ago I was
      rushing about, hundreds of miles from here, trying to attend to the wants
      of a lot of people who seemed determined not to let me get away. Now I'm
      down here in the midst of all this quiet and peace, with you before me to
      look at, and nobody to demand anything of me for at least twenty-four
      hours. It's all too good to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems rather odd to me, too,&rdquo; she answered, letting her eyes stray
      from his and rest upon the bowl of japonicas of a glowing pink, which
      stood in the centre of the table. The candle-light made little starry
      points in her dark eyes as she looked at the rich-hued blooms. &ldquo;The last
      person in the world I was expecting to see to-night was you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I was as far from your thoughts as your expectation,&rdquo; he
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I be thinking of a person who had not written to me for so
      long I thought he had forgotten me?&rdquo; she asked, and then as he broke out
      into a delighted laugh at her expense she grew as, pink as her flowers and
      seemed to welcome the return of Sam bearing a trayful of Sue's good things
      to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fried chicken and sweet potatoes, beaten biscuit and fragrant coffee, had
      a flavour all their own to Burns that night. He ate as a hungry man
      should, yet never forgot his companion for a moment or allowed her to
      imagine that he forgot her. And by and by the meal was over and the two
      rose from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go and see that Auntie is comfortable for the night, if you will
      excuse me for half an hour,&rdquo; said the person he had come to see. &ldquo;Will you
      wait in the drawing-room? I will have Sam bring you some late magazines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll wait, and no magazines, thank you. I can fill the time somehow,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;But don't let it be more than the half-hour, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched her until she disappeared from his sight at the turn of the
      staircase landing, then went in to pace up and down the long room, his
      left arm folded over his right, after the fashion he had acquired since
      the right arm became useless. After what seemed an interminable interval
      she came back. He met her at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the duties all done?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All done for the present. I must look in on Auntie by and by, but I think
      she is going to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May she sleep the sleep of the just! And there's nothing more you feel it
      incumbent upon you to do for me? No more sending me to my room, no more
      waiting upon me by Sam, no more feeding me till my capacity is reached? Is
      there really no notion in your mind as to how you can put off the coming
      hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice had its old, whimsical inflection, but there was a deeper note
      in it, too. She parried him gently, yet not quite so composedly as was her
      wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I want to put if off? Aren't we going to sit down and have a
      delightful talk? I want to hear all about Bob and Martha and all of them,
      and about your work since I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to hear all about those things, do you? I had the impression
      that we discussed them quite thoroughly while I was at supper. Still, I
      can go over them all again if you insist. It may take up another five
      minutes, and when one is fencing for time, even five minutes counts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was his old way, with a vengeance. There was a saying of Arthur
      Chester's current among his and Burns's friends that it never was of any
      use to try to evade Red Pepper when once he had begun to fire upon your
      defenses. With his eyes searching you and his insolent tongue putting
      point blank questions to you, you might as well capitulate first as last.
    </p>
    <p>
      There being no conceivable answer to this thrust about fencing for time,
      even for a woman experienced in replying skilfully to men under all sorts
      of conditions, Ellen Lessing was forced to look up or play the part of a
      shy girl. So she looked up, lifting her head bravely. There really was
      nothing else to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all in his face. He had not come all those hundreds of miles to pay
      her an evening call, nor did he mean to be put off longer. His eyes held
      hers: she could not withdraw them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's odd,&rdquo; he said, speaking slowly, &ldquo;how like a magnet drawing a steel
      bar you've drawn me down here. Pull-pull-pull&mdash;an irresistible force.
      I wonder if the magnet feels the attraction, too? Could it pull so hard if
      it didn't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long minute during which neither stirred&mdash;it might have
      been the counterpart of that minute, months back, when they had first
      observed each other. Recognition it was, perhaps, at the very first; there
      could be no question about the recognition now&mdash;it went deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he slipped his right arm out of the sling. Before she could draw
      breath she was in the circle of his arms, but he had not touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I wrong?&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;Has it pulled both ways from the first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It must be as useless for the magnet to resist as for the bar. And when
      they, have come within a certain distance of each other&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      If Red Pepper's left arm caught her in the stronger grasp, the right did
      all, and more than all, that could have been expected of it. It was his
      right arm which slowly drew her hands up, one after the other, and
      indicated to them that their place was locked together, behind his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old garden in South Carolina is a place to lure the Northerner
      out-of-doors. Before breakfast next morning Burns was walking down the
      box-bordered paths, feasting his gaze and his sense of fragrance on the
      clumps of blue and white violets, the clusters of gay crocuses, the
      splendid spikes of Roman hyacinths. But he did not fail to keep track of
      all doorways in sight, and when she appeared at the open French window of
      the drawing-room he was there in a trice, offering her a bunch of purple
      violets and feasting his eyes upon her morning freshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm still dreaming, I think,&rdquo; said he when he had drawn her back into the
      quiet room long enough to satisfy himself with the active demonstration
      that possession means privilege, and had himself fastened the violets in
      the front of her crisp white morning dress. &ldquo;Dreaming that I can stay down
      here in this wonderful paradise with you and not go back to the slave's
      life I lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would never be happy away from that slave's life long, you know,&rdquo; she
      reminded him. &ldquo;The rush of it is the joy of it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will it be to you? I shall be yours, you remember, till Joe Tressler
      or any other ne'er-do-weel wants me, then I'm his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll always come back to me,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you be content with that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as you want to come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked steadily into her eyes, and his own took fire. &ldquo;Want to come
      back! I've waited a long time to find the woman I could be sure I should
      always want to come back to. I thought there would never be such a woman:
      not for an erratic fellow like me.... But now I'm wondering how I shall
      ever be able to stay away.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. IN WHICH HE DEFIES SUPERSTITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hades of Hymen! Red, are you making calls this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? I'm not to be married till noon, am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, take me with you, will you? I want to go along with a man who has
      the nerve to see patients up to the last minute before his wedding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Takes less nerve than to sit around and wait for the fateful hour, I
      should say. Come on, if you think you'll have time to dress when you get
      back. It may be close work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you got to dress yourself?&rdquo; demanded Arthur Chester, settling
      himself in the car beside its driver. &ldquo;Or shall you go to the altar in
      tweeds with April mud on your boots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather than not get there, yes. But I can dress in half the time you can&mdash;always
      could, and necessity has developed the art. Look here, there isn't any
      April mud. The roads are fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose if I were booked for a wedding journey in the Green Imp
      before the leaves were fairly out I shouldn't be able to see any mud
      myself. As it is, well, I don't know the colour of the bride's motoring
      clothes, but I presume they'll be adapted to the circumstances. I never
      saw her look anything but ready for whatever situation she happened to be
      in. That's a trick that'll serve her many a good turn as the wife of R. P.
      Burns, M.D., eh, Red?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Imp whirled about the country all the morning, having made an early
      start. The car was in fine fettle, like a horse that has been trained for
      a race. Although it was beginning its second season it had never been in
      better trim for business. The engine, having been cared for and seldom
      abused, was running more smoothly than when it had been first put upon the
      road. The Imp had had a fresh coat of the dark-green which gave it its
      name, and its brasswork was shining as only Johnny Caruthers by long and
      untiring labors could make metal shine. It had that morning acquired a
      luggage-rack attached to its rear, which was soon to receive a
      leather-covered motor trunk at that moment receiving its final
      consignments in the Macauley house; and there were several other new
      fittings about the machine which indicated that it was presently to be put
      to uses which had never been required of it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Imp drew up in front of the hospital. Chester looked anxiously at his
      watch for the twenty-seventh time that morning. &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, hurry,
      Red,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Women are the dickens about having a wedding late, and
      it's ten minutes of eleven now. Noon comes sure and soon, and at noon,
      allow me to remind you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burns nodded. &ldquo;Keep cool, boy,&rdquo; he recommended. &ldquo;No use getting excited
      before a critical operation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he disappeared at a pace fast enough to satisfy Chester, who sat back
      and said to himself that R. P. had come nearer giving the crisis before
      him its appropriate name than he had ever heard done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became anxious again, however, before Burns returned, and his watch was
      in his hand when the prospective bridegroom bolted out of the hospital
      door and ran for his car as if he had not a moment to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you're losing your head a trifle at last,&rdquo; commented Chester
      as the Imp turned a dizzy curve and shot away. &ldquo;It's the only proper
      thing. But we've really enough time if you don't stop anywhere else.
      What's the matter? Good Lord, man, you'll get nabbed if you speed up like
      this within limits. You&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut it and don't talk. I've got to make time,&rdquo; was all the answer or
      explanation he received; and Chester, with the wisdom of long association
      with Red Pepper at his pepperest, obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they approached the house Burns spoke for the first time since they had
      left the city. &ldquo;Go in and tell the bunch I have to do an operation at the
      hospital as quick as I can get my stuff and drive back there. I'll be back
      at&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Christopher, man! But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be back by two. Ellen will understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce she will! Don't ask me to explain to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't. I'll do it myself. You tell the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Imp shot up the driveway. Burns jumped out and ran to his office. Five
      minutes later, instrument bag in hand, he ran out again, Miss Mathewson
      following. He bolted in at the Macauleys' front door. Chester had already
      broken the incredible news to Martha Macauley and was standing out a storm
      of expostulations and reproaches, as if by any chance anybody could expect
      Arthur Chester to be able to stop R. P. Burns when he had started upon any
      course of action whatsoever. But when Burns himself appeared at the
      doorway the situation came to a crisis. Towering beside a group of palms
      which decorated the foot of the staircase Burns demanded to see Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Red, you can't. She's&mdash;besides how can you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask her to come where I can speak to her then. Quick, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no knowing how long the sparring might have lasted, or what
      extreme measures might have been taken, had not a figure in a floating
      lilac-and-white garment, with two long braids of dark hair hanging over
      its shoulders, appeared upon the staircase landing. Burns looked up, saw
      it, and was up the stairs to the landing before Chester could flick an
      eyelash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, to save a life I want to delay things just two hours. There's
      nobody else to do it. Van Horn was taken ill just as he was getting ready.
      The only other man who would venture under the conditions&mdash;Grayson&mdash;is
      out of town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His arms were about her as she stood a step above him. So, her eyes were
      level with his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it, of course,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;And take my love with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For one minute Burns stayed to tell her that he had known she would send
      him to his duty, then he was off. The door slammed behind him, and outside
      the Imp's horn sent back a parting salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the bottom stair Martha Macauley, distressed young matron and
      hostess, gazed up at her sister, who, with arms leaning on the
      vine-wreathed rail at the landing, was smiling down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen! Was ever anything so crazy! I did suppose Red would take time
      enough to be married in. There's everybody coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So few you can easily telephone them all to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the breakfast under way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you superstitious enough not to want to postpone your wedding?&rdquo;
       demanded Martha urgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark braids of hair swung violently as the bride's head was
      emphatically shaken. &ldquo;Martha! Take it back! Let somebody die because I was
      afraid to wait two hours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe anybody would die,&rdquo; insisted Martha. &ldquo;Somebody could be
      found. It's just Red's ridiculous craze for surgery. I always said he'd
      rather operate than eat. Now, it seems he'd rather operate than be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment a large, determined hand came over her mouth from
      behind, as James Macauley, junior, arriving upon the scene, asserted his
      authority. He was in bathrobe and slippers, having been excitedly
      interviewed by Chester through the bathroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit fussing, Marty. The thing can't be helped, and if Ellen doesn't mind
      I don't know why we should. If we were having a houseful it would be
      fierce, but with only ourselves and the Chesters and the minister's family
      and Red's people&mdash;I'll go telephone Mr. Harding now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Martha freed herself from the silencing hand the front door opened
      again. This time it was Mrs. Richard Warburton&mdash;Burns's young sister
      Anne&mdash;also in somewhat informal attire, over which she had thrown an
      evening coat. She surveyed the group with laughing eyes. She herself had
      been married within the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's absurd, isn't it?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But it's just like Red. Ellen knows
      that, don't you, dear? Ellen'll not only take him for better and for
      worse, but for present and for absent&mdash;mostly absent! But we're
      rather proud of him over at the house. Father's walking up and down and
      saying no other fellow would have done it, and Mother's all tearful and
      smiling. Dick wanted to go in with him, but of course Miss Mathewson had
      to go: he seldom operates without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's so uncertain when he'll get back,&rdquo; mourned Martha, still
      unreconciled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made Miss Mathewson promise to telephone, the moment she should know.
      It's lucky the wedding guests are all in the family, isn't it? Ellen,
      dear&rdquo;&mdash;pretty Anne ran up the stairs to the landing&mdash;&ldquo;I really
      don't see how, after he caught sight of you in that fascinating garb, with
      your hair down, he could ever tear himself away! You're positively the
      loveliest thing I ever saw in all my life, and I'm almost out of my senses
      with joy that you're to be my sister, even though I never saw you in the
      world till yesterday! I always said when Red did care for anybody for
      keeps, she'd be a jewel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red Pepper came back at precisely twenty minutes of three. His patient had
      given him a bad hour of anxiety immediately after leaving the table, and
      he could not desert her until she had rallied. But he felt easy about her
      now, and he had arranged to leave her in Buller's hands&mdash;Buller, who
      did not do major surgery himself, but was a most competent man when it
      came to the care of surgical patients after operation. Burns brought Amy
      Mathewson back with him, though she had begged to be allowed to stay with
      the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not be at my wedding?&rdquo; cried Red Pepper, in exuberant spirits. &ldquo;Why,
      I couldn't be properly married without you to see me through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon which she had smiled and obeyed him, and taken a tighter grip upon
      herself as he put her into the Green Imp for the last ride together. That
      was what it was to her, though she might yet go with him a thousand times
      to help him in his work. To him it was a quick and joyful journey back to
      his marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mother and Dad!&rdquo; he exulted, coming in upon them in their
      festal array. He shook hands with his father and his brother-in-law; he
      kissed his mother. Then he ran for his own room where Bobby Burns, just
      being finished off by Anne, herself superbly dressed, shrieked with
      rapture at the sight of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red! At last! I've laid everything ready; you've only to jump into your
      bath; I turned on the water when Dick saw the Imp down the road. Don't you
      dare have a vestige of a surgical odour about you when you come out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In precisely seventeen minutes and three-quarters the bridegroom was ready
      to the last coppery affair on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I a 'surgical odour,' Anne?&rdquo; he asked as he came up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She buried her face on his shoulder, both arms about him, regardless of
      her finery. &ldquo;You're the dearest, sweetest old trump of a brother that ever
      lived, and you smell like sunshine and fresh air!&rdquo; she cried. Whereat he
      shook with laughter and patted her back as she clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise me, Red,&rdquo; she begged, lifting her head, &ldquo;that you won't let
      anything&mdash;anything&mdash;keep you from going off with Ellen in the
      Imp. She's been so lovely about this horrid delay, but I'm always
      suspicious of you. Promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you this,&rdquo; agreed her brother: &ldquo;Wherever the Imp and I go,
      after the minister has said the words, for this two weeks Ellen shall go
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p><br />
      &ldquo;Chester,&rdquo; said Dick Warburton as he stood in that gentleman's company,
      looking over a stupendous assortment of wedding gifts, which, in spite of
      the fact that nobody outside the family had been asked to see Redfield
      Pepper Burns married, overflowed two large rooms into the upper hall and
      almost over the railing, &ldquo;will you tell me who in the name of time sent
      that rat-trap? This is the most extraordinary display of gold, silver, and
      tinware that I ever saw, and I'm at the end of my astonishment. But that
      rat-trap, is it a joke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No joke whatever&mdash;,&rdquo; declared Chester. &ldquo;It comes from one of
      Red's devoted friends&mdash;his own invention. And the point of the
      thing is that the making of that rat-trap is going to be the making of the
      worst dead-beat of a patient Red ever stood by. I really believe Joe
      Tressler's going to get a patent on it, which also will be Red's doing.
      But this is a special, particular rat-trap made of extra fine materials,
      suitable for a wedding gift!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; mused Burns's brother-in-law. &ldquo;And what millionaire sent the
      diamond pendant? By Jove, I haven't seen finer jewels than those this side
      of the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That came from the Walworths, I believe. Take it all together, it's a
      great collection, isn't it? It shows up the odder because Ellen wouldn't
      have the freak grateful-patient gifts put to one side&mdash;or even thrown
      into a sort of refining shadow. Fix your eye on that rainbow quilt, will
      you, Dicky, alongside of the Florentine tapestry? That quilt would put out
      your eye if you gazed upon it steadily, so let up on it by regarding this
      match-safe. Wouldn't that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That came from Johnny Caruthers,&rdquo; said a richly modulated low voice
      behind him. &ldquo;Please set it down carefully, Mr. Arthur Chester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men wheeled to see the bride come to the defense of her wedding
      gifts. Behind her loomed her husband, laughing over her head, his eyes
      none the less tender, like hers, for the queer presents which meant no
      less of love and gratitude than the costlier gifts, of which there was no
      mean array.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you've married him, patients and all, Ellen Burns,&rdquo; declared
      Richard Warburton. &ldquo;On the whole, it's your wisest course. The less he
      knows you mind their devotion to him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind it!&rdquo; She gave him the flash of which the soft black eyes were
      brilliantly capable. &ldquo;Dick, I have no gift I like so well as that
      rat-trap. You don't know the story, but I do, and it means to me&mdash;fidelity
      to duty. And if there's one great big thing in the world I think it's
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over her head, Dick Warburton nodded at his brother-in-law. &ldquo;I'm glad
      we've got her into the family, Red,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It's a mighty rare thing to
      find a beautiful woman who knows how to dress like a picture, with that
      ideal at the back of her head! Cherish her, Red. If you don't I'll come
      around and knock you down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll let you do it,&rdquo; agreed Burns soberly. All his marriage vows were in
      his face.
    </p>
    <p><br />
      It was quite dusk when the Green Imp got away. Johnny Caruthers had the
      satisfaction of lighting up the car's lamps&mdash;always a joy to him, and
      particularly so to-night, for even the oil taillight bore witness to his
      trimming and polishing till its red eye could gleam no brighter. As for
      the front lamps and the searchlight the Imp's progress would be as down an
      avenue of brilliance if its driver allowed them all full play upon the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's in great trim, Johnny,&rdquo; said Burns's voice in his ear. &ldquo;I like her
      looks immensely. I shall hate to get a speck of mud on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning the lady, Doc?&rdquo; asked Johnny anxiously. &ldquo;There's a wet bit there
      under the elms, Doc, remember. It would be a pity to splash any mud on
      her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced toward the porch, his freckled face eloquent of his admiration
      for the figure which was the centre of the group gathered there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns's eyes followed his. Bob, a picturesque, small person in his wedding
      attire of white linen, was attempting to tie Ellen's motor-veil for her,
      as she stooped, smiling, to the level of his eager little arms. It
      occurred to both master and man, as they watched the child's efforts to
      adjust the floating chiffon, that veils, however useful, were to be
      regretted when they were allowed even partially to obscure faces like
      those of Red Pepper's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant the car, lad,&rdquo; explained Burns, laughing. &ldquo;You've done a great
      piece of work an her since I brought her home this afternoon. I'm afraid
      you've done some last polishing with your wedding clothes on, Johnny.
      Here's something to take the spots out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Doc!&rdquo; breathed the boy. &ldquo;Not to-night, Let me do it&mdash;for you&mdash;and
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The money went back into Burns's pocket, and his hand met Johnny's in a
      hearty grasp. &ldquo;That's better yet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and thank you, John. If
      anybody but you were sending me off I'd ask if everything was surely in
      the car But I'll not even ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't need to,&rdquo; vowed the boy proudly. &ldquo;And there's some things in
      you don't need to know about, just extrys in case of breakdown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that,&rdquo; said his employer, &ldquo;is what call proving one's self a
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Imp went cautiously through the &ldquo;wet bit,&rdquo; for it lay under the corner
      arc-light, and Johnny Caruthers would be watching. But, once on the open
      road outside the village, the pace quickened. For late April the roads
      were not bad, and if they had been sloughs the Imp could have pulled
      through them. She had a great power hidden away in those six cylinders of
      hers, had the Imp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll not mind if I stop at the hospital as we go through?&rdquo; questioned
      Burns. &ldquo;Then we'll be off, out the old west road, out of reach of
      telephones and summonses of any sort. But I shall be just that much
      easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do stop, please. I'm sure you'll be more satisfied and so shall I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat quietly in the car while he was gone looking up at the lighted
      windows and thinking all sorts of sympathetic thoughts concerning those
      inside&mdash;yet with a tiny fear in her heart that he would find some new
      and unavoidable duty to detain him. If he should&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was back, and as the Imp's searchlight fell upon his face,
      returning, she read there that he was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing well, everything satisfactory, and I've not a care in the world,&rdquo;
       he exulted as he leaped in. &ldquo;Now we're off, and never a stop till we've
      put a wide space between us and the rest of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Green Imp ran at its quietest along the city streets, then through the
      thinning suburbs, and finally, with the lights all behind them, the open
      country ahead, the long, low car came out upon the straight highway which
      leads a hundred miles before it comes again to any but insignificant
      hamlets and small, rustic inns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns had said little thus far, but as he glanced over his shoulder at the
      now distant lights of the city he suddenly spoke low, out of the quiet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're out of reach of everything and everybody; nobody even knows the
      road we're taking. We're all alone in the world together. You can't think
      what that means to me. I've lived nine years at the call of every soul
      that wanted me: hardly a vacation except for study. A fortnight seems
      pretty short allowance for a honeymoon; we'll take a longer one when we go
      to Germany in the fall. But&mdash;for two weeks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her in the April starlight. He bent to finish the
      statement, whatever it might have been, upon her lips, for speech failed
      him. Then, with a happy laugh, he gave the Green Imp her head.
